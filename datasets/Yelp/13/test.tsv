I took my car to them to get the AC evac'd and refilled with freon. The guy who did it overfilled it so the compressor seized up. I paid them $82 for this crap job. When I went back to them they said they couldn't do anything about it and tried to shunt me to some mechanic they \""work with\"", along with a coupon, which makes me suspect there's shenanigans going on between these two businesses.  \n\nNow I'm looking at paying at least another $750 to get my AC repaired, with no apology or refund from Jiffy Lube for breaking my system. The company hasn't even responded to the email I wrote them after the last visit. I won't be going to their \""friend\"" for repairs, that's for sure! \n\nI've been taking cars to this Jiffy Lube for years and am VERY disappointed that they would treat a long-time customer like this. What happened, Jiffy Lube? You used to be cool!\n\nAnyway, don't take your car here. They'll break it.	negative
Finally a decent downtown Thai food place with good lunch prices. Actually, the first decent mom and pop restaurant serving an Asian cuisine I've been to downtown.\n\nThis place is a godsend from the over-priced likes of Wild Thaiger and Fate. It features really tasty and authentic lunch specials which run 6.95 and come with a small soup and a spring roll. I got a Pad Khing which was absolutely delicious and spicy. It's been a long time since I've had that dish that good.\n\nI also really like the diner experience for a small lunch. The only downer is that if you go with more then four people you will likely be sat in this attached dining room which has an awkward company-sponsored-increase-teamwork-dinner vibe. Although it still has the groovy 70s brown and orange lamps that are throughout the restaurant, which are a highlight fo' sho'.\n\nThe thai iced tea rawked my world too. Milkier then usual, but delicious.	positive
I love the food here. This was my 4th visit. Our waiter was awesome. Good sense of humor. We used a groupon, yessss Sir. Our waiter suggested different margaritas, my bestie had strawberry & I had a Cadillac margarita. All I can say is delicious. At the end the cashier tryed to over charge me but it was taken care of. I will be back.	positive
Hmmm, let's hire only one server for an entire busy lunchtime crowd and see how it goes. Meanwhile tattoo boy is staring at the waitress from behind the counter doing nothing. What is your purpose dude? You made it over to my table and put on menu on there, but you couldn't take my order?  I received water, but nothing else as I then decided to grab a take-out order.\nNO WHITE MEAT CHICKEN. This is a sign of a cheap place. Only the drive through taco joints don'[t serve white meat - you would expect it from a sit down joint. Waste of space. What do you do with the white meat of the chicken? Do you throw it out - cause if your smoking your own meats then the chicken comes with white meat. They are just too lazy to separate the meat. Can't take this place seriously.	negative
Bought a daily deal coupon thing for this place and enjoyed my dinner very much.  Staff were friendly and accommodating and happy to accept my coupon deal and didn't treat me like a second class customer.\nMenu options were explained, questions about cocktail selections were answered and food was delivered promptly.\nSushi was very good and tasted fresh.  Rolls were creative and overall were a good price/quality ratio while the warm sake really hit the spot.  I will be happy to return with or without a coupon in the future	positive
I loved it!!!  I was really surprised...  The portions are huge and tasted amazing.  I can't eat eggs (I know - what am I doing there right??) but I can eat pancakes, waffles...  I thought this would be another breakfast out eating the same thing BUT, they serve lunch for breakfast too - yay for me!! I had an awesome spinach salad with chicken, apple, cranberries, walnuts...  Breakfast salad : )  It was perfect.  My boyfriend had a skillet/scrambler thing and he said it was awesome.  Nice pieces of veggies, good amount of meat...  Service was wonderful!  (Don't miss this just because it's a chain!!)	positive
this was our second visit and again we don't  get it.  the food is not served hot!  the dishes have good flavors, but who wants to eat cold food?\n  we were treating guests at the first visit, and 4 out of 6 dinners were cold.  i thought perhaps with just two people it would fare better.  no, it did not.  the waitress took the dishes back to the kitchen to reheat.  unfortunately, when she brought back what she thought were hot meals, (they were slightly warm by the time they made it back to the table) she neglected to also get us new rice so that would be hot.  now we are left with putting lukewarm food on cold rice.  when we asked for hot rice, the waitress was happy to provide some---eventually.  she never told the manager there was a problem.  when i spoke to him on the way out,  i was met with a dismissive sorry about that and have a good night.  \nit is a nice looking restaurant with friendly waiters.  the tea was served steaming hot.  now if they could only do that with the rest of the dishes!	negative
Good atmosphere but bad food and service. The $60 Steak I ordered was burned and we had to wait another 30 minutes for a second one. The waiter never apologized for the inconvenience.	negative
This gym is the worst I've ever been to, but it's really close and I like the franchise because I travel.  Their hours suck-open at 8AM on Saturday?  Really? Their music is often so loud you can hear it over your own headphones, it has a bad odor, the cardio deck has a 30 minute run limit on all machines - you can't set the work-out time more than that - JOKE!  And the staff is rude.	negative
The lemon blueberry pancakes were pretty good. The food in general was good. The place gets packed every weekend, there was a wait when we got there. But we had to pack our food up right when it came to the table and leave. There were quite a few flies around the front area. Very bothersome, kept getting at our food. None of the staff said anything about it or even tried to acknowledge the fact that they were there.  I would have given more stars but it was very irritating to try to keep them away from our food.	negative
Bocata has a eclectic, funky decor and a cozy, dark, cavernous vibe. More importantly, they have a good wine list (creatively pasted in the pages of an old book) and a pretty decent by-the-glass wine selection. You can order a half or a full glass, which is fun because you can try more that way. If you ask nicely, they might even give you a tasting sample to try before you commit. The per glass prices are a little steep, but pretty on par for the neighbourhood (Old Montreal).\n\nThey also do some really tasty tapas-sized dishes. The salmon tartare is refreshingly innovative, the oysters are fresh, and there's usually some dish involving lobster.  They also occasionally hold special tasting events (for example, a tasting menu paired with Spanish wines, wines from Jura, sherry, etc.). Although it is technically a wine bar, they do seem to expect you to order food, and I would recommend going for a light meal or snack rather than just for drinks. It's a small space, so reservations are recommended to avoid disappointment.	positive
Went to Bob Taylor's for a steak and was disappointed in the whole experience. The service was very slow and the food was sub-par. It's comparable to outback, but a little more expensive. My wife had the smoked prime rib and it was hard to choke down because the flavor was overpowering. Not sure if we just don't have a taste for smoked prime rib... I had the sirloin and it was very salty and not a high quality cut of beef. Overall it's nothing special at Bob Taylors.	negative
Okay, so after a game of golf, we decide to chow down some burgers. We were told by the concierge to try this place and so we did.\n\nDisappointment. Granted the fact that this establishment is in the heart of Scottsdale, which is known as high rent district with all the attitude of hoity-toity people. \n\nHamburger/Cheeseburger and a side of fries for $12-$14 is outlandish. The fact that this restaurant had various choices in beer and wine rack shouldn't be the reason for such pricing. By the time the meal and couple of alcoholic beverages were consumed, average price of each person came to about $22 before gratuity. \n\nI suppose everyone has his/her own standard or benchmark. But $22 for a GROUND BEEF and 2 beer does not stack up well on price to value ratio. Either they need to improve their marketing by convincing the diners that, this is more than just a burger place or they need to convince the diners that they are eating something much more than a burger while eating a burger.\n\nMeat was good, no flavour however and was not cooked to order; I ordered medium but came out well-done. The staff was good to excellent--good waiting staff, excellent bus staff. \n\nEveryone in the party agreed that, we could have had a lot more for what we paid; or reversely, we could have had what we had elsewhere for a lot less cost.	negative
I love Mexican food.  El Dorado has decent food, but for the price there is much better.  Their guacamole is very plain and tastes more like mashed avocados with a scoop of Pico De Gallo on top, then guacamole.  I have had the fish tacos which were par for the course, and the braised pork adobo.   Portions of the pork were juicy and delicious, while other bites were dry.  It seemed as if reheated pork was mixed with fresh pork.\n\nThe service is slow and disappointing.  The guacamole came out fast, but the chips took 5 minutes.  The server decided to add chicken to the South West Caesar salad for my vegetarian girl friend.  After we finished our salad and guacamole it took thirty minutes for our entrees to arrive and being charged for salsa at a Mexican restaurant is just odd.\n\nThey do have a good selection of tequilas.	negative
When I moved in in 2010, I'd have probably given them a 4-star rating.  The location is great, the management (we called them the \""Golden Girls\"") was friendly and knew me by name, and maintenance response times were quick and efficient.  Any issues I had were politely handled by the friendly, \""motherly\"" ladies in the office.  They handed out bagged breakfasts on occasion in the mornings as you'd drive out of the complex, had popcorn popping in the office for residents, movie rentals available, and really went out of their way for the residents.  THAT version of the Cortesian gets at least a 4-star rating from me.\n\nThen, Alliance took over in 2012.  The Cortesian went downhill FAST.  They canned all the office staff and replaced them with a bunch of young know-nothings.  Every time I went in there somebody new was working who had no idea who I was, etc.  Not very welcoming or home-y.  Random employees coming and going, no consistency.  Maintenance issue response times at least doubled.  I was used to getting things addressed by the old management within a day or so.... waiting a week became common.  The maitenance guy was nice - but there was only one, so they're WAY understaffed now.  Included utilities became a thing of the past.  While they renovated the laundry rooms, the new (and cheap) machines, along with the new credit card machine, are ALWAYS out of order.  Every weekend there were more machines NOT working than there were working.  Know how they clean the pools?  THEY DUMP BOTTLES OF CLOROX IN THEM.  I've seen them do it.  The fitness center was rehabbed but is consistently closed for who knows why.   I can't even count how many times I woke up to cold showers and the hot water not working.  A cold shower is always a great start to the day.\n\nThey re-painted the exterior of all the buildings, but told us less than a day beforehand to clear off our balconies, otherwise our items would be disposed.  Luckily I checked my junk mail to find that email, but I'm sure others found it too late.  Maitenance/rehab work has been going on forever with the swimming pools, and it starts at about 7 am (as does landscaping), so good luck trying to sleep in once in awhile.  The office staff also treated my wife extremely rudely when she tried to retrieve a fob for the laundry rooms, which I was none too pleased about. \n\nRoaches, bugs.... I could go on and on.  It's amazing how the management and office staff ruined what was a nice place when I moved in.  I think the icing on the cake is their website, which depicts models and buildings not even associated with the Cortesian, and they call themselves a \""renovated masterpiece\"" on it.  So add false advertising to the list.  Very glad to be out.	negative
This place is amazing! Top notch burgers, amazing Mac n Cheese, a whole slew of great beers, and a ton of big screen TVs! On top of that, service is EXCELLENT, as is the management! Servers are free to wear whatever sports team's apparel they choose, adding to the melting pot experience that is Old Scottsdale. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a good solid burger or sandwich, a good beer, and a great place to unwind on the patio under the cooling misters. Prices aren't bad either, especially for the experience. I WILL be back!	positive
I've tried most of the menu items. I think the best is the halloumi (vegetarian) one. The batter is lightly spiced and really good. The cheese is really delicious especially when it's hot enough. When it cools down the cheese becomes dry, and rubbery.	positive
I went to Dr. Zenner for a couple of years and never got much out of it besides my meds refill. Very rude office staff what there is of it. He spent to much time talking about himself and current events than asking me my issues. I was just glad when I got out of there and didn't have to come back for 4 months.	negative
The food was average. There wasn't anything special that set them apart from other steak houses. I ordered the braised lobster while my friend ordered the rib eye. We shared so we can both have a surf n turf kind of meal. The steak was ok. I felt it need a little more seasoning. The lobster was overcooked. It was a chewy mess. My mom got the rack of lamb. She hardly had anything on her plate after she trimmed off the fat. The sides were horribly bland. We got the spinach and asparagus. I loved the sides at Brand in Monte Carlo. I was thoroughly disappointed with the sides here. Anyone can throw a high grade piece of meat on the grill and make it taste good but a good chef can make something boring like spinach taste spectacular. I was expecting somewhere between good and spectacular for $$$$. I would give this place 3 stars but the service sucked. This older black guy waited on us and he neglected us the whole night. He never once refilled my coke. Not once in the 2 hours we were there. He also dropped off dessert menus on our table and didn't return for another 30 mins to take our order. Unfortunately by then we were just over it. I'm pretty understanding when a place is super busy or short staffed but it was neither. I would not recommend this place to anyone esp since there are so many good places to eat in Vegas.	negative
This is my first ever time trying this chain.  I am pleasantly surprised!!! MUCH better than \""Taco Hell\"".  My fixin's were fresh, the meat was well seasoned.  I was afraid to try it because fat Mexican food can be really gross.  I'm not opposed to pulling into another one of these drive thrus in the future now! Food is 3/5 but with their affordable menu pricing I added a star.  Where else can you get lunch for under $5!!!	positive
I LOVE Sam's Town! I am not a local and have been coming here for 8 years.  I love everything about it.  \nIf you want to stay out of the Vegas heat Sam's Town has plenty to do without leaving the casino.\nLarge Bowling Alley\nMulti plex theater\nArcade\npool and hot tub\nTons of dining options\nIndoor park with waterfalls, creek, \""animals\"", water show, and laser show when it gets dark. The roof if all glass so there is a ton of natural light coming in on the park.\nVarious entertainment\nBingo\nAnd of course gambling\nThe rooms have always been clean and modern and the suites have a good amount of space. Ask for a park view room and you won't be disappointed.\nThe run a FREE shuttle to the strip and downtown several times a day.\nAlways plenty of parking if you park yourself.\nRight across the street is Wal-Mart incase you forgot something.	positive
As you will guess by its name, Gourmet Pasta doesn't just specialise in Italian food, but in pasta alone and this could be where the secret of its success lies.  The menu is extensive and it always takes me at least ten minutes to decide which dish to try as they all look, sound and smell amazing.  They serve the usual carbonara, bolognese and lasagne, but also lesser known and more original sauces like roasted red pepper and tomato and a special anchovy and chilli spaghetti.  \nWhat's more is that all the pasta is completely fresh and made to order.  This, combined with the fresh ingredients used in the sauces, makes each dish taste all the better.  Further, the service is quick and welcoming, depite it getting quite busy around lunch and dinner time.  The icing on the cake is that it's incredibly cheap for the quality of the food.  Most of the dishes are sold at under \u00a35 and the portions are far from stingy.  \nI honestly cannot fault this place from any perspective and urge anyone with an interest in a cheap, tasty dinner to visit it soon.	positive
2.8 stars. \n\nKitchen seems to emphasize quantity over quality. Was hoping for a more Southern-themed menu but offerings seemed fairly standard, boring presentation. \n\nChicken & waffles wasn't overly impressive - chicken was v. tender, lightly breaded, paired w/a standard Belgian waffle. Omelette was gigantic, portioned to share.\n\nBreakfast menu here: https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.mirage.com/files/bb_kings_blues_breakfast_menu.pdf&pli=1\n\nFYI bankruptcy dispute 2/25/11\nhttp://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/feb/25/bankrupt-blues-club-mirage-invoicing-dispute/	negative
What happened lotus cuisine? You used to be OK but now you just don't care anymore. The last 3 dishes I've ordered from you tasted awful and the local me in in particular had as much flavor and eye appeal as a cup of water. You no longer deserve my business.	negative
Finally, North Scottsdale has a fast food Mexican restaurant!!! Not Sure if it ever really needed one?? Okay food, Nothing that stands out... I tried their Signature Carne' Asada Taco's and a Cheese Quesadilla with their Grilled chicken... Good choices.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to get there, I just happen to have to drive past it, at least twice a day during the week, and still have only been there on one occasion.  I would agree with another reviewer, the staff is indifferent, and does act like  you are intruding on their time.	negative
Delightful atmosphere that is full of color and wonderful design. Mariachis were playing tableside which made the atmosphere fun! You immediately think good food is ahead....\n\nThe food....not so great. The food was very bland. The chips did not seem homemade. The menu suggests wonderful flavors in their food, but there actually  wasn't any pizazz or flavor to anything we had. Don't pay extra to try any of the salsas....bleh.\n\nThe service was horrible. The waiter did not know the menu nor could he make recommendations as to what the best food was on the menu. I flat out asked him what was most popular and he pointed out a salad. He didn't understand us when we asked questions and he did get some of our order wrong. \n\nI am really shocked how packed it was considering the flavors weren't good. We had tacos, quesadillas, beans/rice and tried various salsas. If you like authentic Mexican Food native to Arizona, this isn't the place for you. \n\nThe food was overpriced and the drinks seemed reasonably priced. I will not go back to this place.	negative
So I've now stayed at MGM, TheHotel at Mandalay Bay, Golden Nugget, and now the Wynn.  I have mixed feelings about my stay.  Obviously the bed was so comfortable that I wanted to buy it in the Home Store.  But instead bought my queen bed at Macys for about 1100 dollars cheaper.   We arrived late and check-in was a breeze.   It was checking out the day after XMAS that took about 30 mins.  The room service was top notch.  Probably the best I've ever experienced.  I'm still dreaming about that lobster the first night i was there.  I just felt like I wanted it to be breathe taking and I was surprised that my bathtub at TheHotel was larger.  I was surprised that there weren't more activities besides the nightclubs around XMAS time.  I tipped 20 bucks to see if I could get a better room but I realized later I don't think it worked.  I prebooked on booking.com months in advance.  The location on the strip I like a lot because you just start walking and not feeling like you're really far and you can hop on the bus.  It gorgeous inside.  I just get the feeling that maybe you get more perks with the towers or the nicer suites.   That maybe just getting a regular room here at the Wynn, can you get a really nice suite elsewhere.  And even for us working people paying 700-800 for 3 nights is a lot (w/o room service included, and the spa) we just want the works.  I'll def be back.  I know my boyfriend who is vegan, was happy to have the options, but felt like it wasn't actually that great tasting of what he tried between Tableau, room service, and the buffet.\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm a fan and had a great time.  I just don't know if we really got our moneys worth.\n\nAnd I hope they put an ice cream parlour somewhere in the Wynn because you have to try their homemade ice cream for room service!!!	positive
One Sunday afternoon, my boyfriend and I couldn't decide what to eat. And so we searched on Yelp Japanese. And came across Shabu Shabu less than 2 miles away from where we were. We were like sure why not, we've never tried Shabu Shabu. We entered into a small restaurant with burner tables. The room had to be big enough for 30-40 people. And it was not so busy, which was a plus being such a small restaurant. \n\nWe had no clue what to order or how it worked, but the kind lady was nice enough to explain. Luckily there was an expert couple sitting two tables away from us to further demonstrate and explain each step when the waitress was not available to answer our 1000 questions. \n\nWe ordered the original shabu shabu sauce with chicken and shrimp. It came with vegetables and noodles. We had a fun experience cooking our food in the pot of boiling water and seaweed. Slowly you add all the ingredients to cook all at the same time, instead of waiting hahaha. It was our first time and we loved the experience and the taste. I would love to try other shabu shabu just don't know where they might be in the Vegas area.	positive
This is place is like a stop, a stop where you get off if you want games. Hence Gamestation.\n\nGamestation is very well stocked, convenient game shop. Unsurprisingly it offers all the latest games, but more importantly a good selection of reasonably prices second hand games (which are often on sale). Its for this reason that Gamestation has also seemed to me better than its seemingly rival GAME. This Gamestation is particularly large and also offers retro fun, and video game spin off merchandise like T-Shirts and toys, which if you ask me are overpriced and marketed to a special kind of \""collector\"".\n\nYou might think that GAME, literally mere paces down the road, might make for stiff competition, but don't be fooled. GAME now owns Gamestation. If you want small independent game shops, you have to look hard. Fortunately Edinburgh has its very own \""Chips\"" on Nicholson Street.\n\nThe only real competition that Gamestation has is the online market, particularly second hand games from Amazon and Play, but as its stands it managing to compete on that front at least. And at least here you can browse, speak to real flesh and blood people, and sometimes come across great deals you weren't expecting.	positive
Went here just a couple of days ago for my first time. i'll start out with the service first. Our waitress was friendly, funny and on the ball! There was never a moment during our entire meal that we were sitting there waiting for her to show up to refill a drink or help us. And I also want to make note of the fact that each waiter/waitress was dressed in white from head to toe and not one uniform that we saw was out of place. Each person was dressed perfectly without a stain or blemish on their clothing. And for anyone that has worked in food service you know this isn't an easy thing to do. \n\nWe ordered appetizers to start out the meal, crab wontons and the warm crab artichoke dip. OMG let me tell you what both of the appetizers were amazing. The crab artichoke dip was perfectly hot temp wise, seasoned perfectly and there were tons of lump crab pieces in it, came with a toasted garlic sourdough bread what a perfect combo. The crab wontons also came out a perfect temp and that pop of fresh green onion flavor combined with the sweet spicy dipping sauce was to die for. \n\nMy husband ordered the filet mignon, it came with sweet potato fries, onion rings and he added a side of steamed asparagus. I myself ordered the factory combo that came with the steak diane, shrimp scampi and their house mashed potatoes. For me the steak was tasty and cooked perfectly, the shrimp however I felt was a tad over cooked and i've had far better scampi's from other restaurants, not that it was awful, just could have been better. Now the mashed potatoes, sweet baby jesus these things were delightful, they used red potatoes and there were still nice random lumps of potato throughout which I enjoy, the seasonings they used were on point and I just couldn't stop eating them. My husband said that his filet was perfectly cooked and that his whole meal was tasty, he even proclaimed that it was one of the best filet's he's ever had. \n\nNow for the cheesecake he ordered the lemon raspberry and I got the red velvet. Let me tell you what that red velvet cheesecake is amazing, I have an affinity for anything red velvet and am quite stringent on my standards of a good red velvet. The cake itself was moist and tasty and when surrounded by layers of cheesecake and crusted with white chocolate curls and garnished with real deal whipped cream this stuff is the business. I would go back just for the cheesecake.	positive
Happy Hour was awesome at The yard House. The Ahi Stack was great and $5!! wow!! Loads of beer...choices.. Good times!!! Great happy hour!	positive
Ordered the Kung Pao Chicken all day special and was impressed by everything I got. Wonton, Shrimp, Egg Roll, Fried Rice, and obviously my Kung Pao. I would've also got soup but the lady assumed I wasn't staying in so I just decided not to. My only complaint would be that there wasn't much chicken in the Kung Pao Chicken.	positive
I find this place boring. It's entertaining sure but I expected more figuring so many people talk about it. All you do is jump around on a thousand trampolines. Not for toddlers I don't think. More for older kids. We stayed a little then came to monkey joes. I find it to be a lot more fun and entertaining. Definitely keeps my son busy for quite a few hours.	negative
I wish I could speak as highly of this place as I do all the other restaurants in the Golden Nugget, but I simply cannot.  During our 9 -day stay in Las Vegas, we visited this caf\u00e9 several times and the service at each visit was more disappointing than the last.  After four visits, we decided that it was not going to get any better.  It is clear that the staff here is unionized and they seem to take advantage of this security by not bothering to expend energy to be courteous or timely in their service.  The food is mediocre at best (think Denny's) yet overpriced and served begrudgingly.  Note: the coffee here is plentiful but acrid.  \n\nOne visit stands out: after being seated by a hostess who didn't bother to speak to us or even make eye contact, a person (bus person, assistant?) inquired as to whether we would like something to drink.  We ordered two coffees, two water and two large orange juices.  This person said to us \""I can get you water and coffee but orange juice must be ordered from your server...pleeeeease!\"" It was obvious to both of us that we were being scolded for breaching an unknown and unspoken \""rule\"" about orange juice.  Our server finally came and almost convinced us that he wasn't totally bored while taking our order (including orange juice).  The meal took 15 minutes to arrive, sans OJ.  Later the server brought the check, reviewing it as he placed it on the table, and asked \""Did you ever get your orange juice?\""  We began to reiterate to him that we were told that only he could take that order but he abruptly walked away.  He did return with our OJ...just as we finished our meal.  We definitely could've lived without the OJ...and the attitude from the service staff. \n\nThis place is large, open 24 hours and very close to the pool but those are its only positive qualities.  There are other viable options on Fremont Street...especially for breakfast!  Du-Par's in the Golden Gate is the BEST!   If you do decide to dine here, my advice is to keep your expectations low.	negative
Please see Mr Ghetto - Walmart on youtube before reading this review. The wally world featured on this video is cleaner and better stocked than the one in this location. You have to wade through the small army of lazy bums panhandling (saw one in a leather jacket one time) before getting to the store or back to your car every time! I avoid taking my family here for safety sake so i usually go here by myself. That's only if I really have to go here unless I want to drive the extra 10 min to go to a better walmart down Craig Road.	negative
The translated \""Il Vinaio\"" is an ancient Italian word meaning \""polished turd\"". The pretentious menu, the \""Denny's\"" environment. The dated and uninspiring wine list. Fake yelp reviews, rude replies to yelp reviews.  Reviews that have no other reviews or friends, are obviously  fake yelp profiles, sad . Clearly unprofessional \""foodies\"" have no place in the restaurant industry, this place makes the Taco Bell next door  look bad. Keep polishing that turd, I heard the best way is to suck at both ends.	negative
I came to watch a friend's Roller Derby match. The facility looks like it may have been pretty great once, but doesn't appear to have been maintained well. The floos don't seem like they've had a good cleaning in a long time. Everything just seems a little dated and worn out.	negative
I love that most of their employees make it known that they would rather be anywhere else but here. \nThe prices are higher than most other competitors but it's the closest store to us so it's easy to get to.	negative
We were on a hunt for food before seeing a show at the Garden and settled on Emeril's. I love experiencing a chef's vision and was really excited to finally see Emeril's come to life. We chose this spot because they had a large bar and a TV and hoped to catch some football before continuing on with our night's festivities and get some tasty bites. \n\nUnfortunately, this experience has made me think twice about not only my fixation about going to a \""mainstream\"" chef's restaurant but also my admiration for Emeril. \n\nFirst, when we arrived there were two people at the bar and approximately twenty or so employees that appeared to be setting up for dinner service. The hostess up front greeted us and after explaining that we wanted to try to watch some football, suggested we sit at the bar. Perfect, so far so good. We were seated at the bar and waited....and watched as the bartenders and bar backs moved back and forth. Not one person greeted us for ten minutes...I understand that there is a certain amount of prep work required before the dinner service, but not acknowledging patrons is inexcusable. Once we finally were able to flag a bartender, we politely asked if we would be able to switch the channel on the TV to one that showed the game. The bartender said that he would have to ask the other patrons if that was fine which made sense but he was so dismissive that it automatically got my defenses up. Apparently, we were bothering him by asking him to change the channel on the TV. There were only two other patrons at the bar and thought that it wouldn't be an issue, but apparently it was for this bartender. Luckily, he made himself useful and actually got the channel changed but not after asking the other patrons which were more than obliging but then he told us that he would have to ask his manager...huh? Five minutes previous, he said that if the other patrons were OK with it then he would change it...now, we had to wait for his manager to approve? I thought restaurants were all about hospitality seeing that their business is contingent upon their patrons happiness and satisfaction. It was clear how our dinner experience was going to be after this....\n\nSo, we did this dance for about twenty minutes until we were asked what we wanted to order....He got the gnocchi and I ordered the Sea Bass....I inquired about an ingredient in the Sea Bass that I wasn't familiar with and instead of telling me he didn't know what it was, the bartender made up some lame answer about the ingredient. He told me it was something like a \""crustini\"". I'm no trained chef, but I know my way around a kitchen and have a good concept about tastes and ingredients. Not being satisfied with his answer, I googled it and low and behold, it was NOTHING like a crustini but an ingredient that included pork....huh? Do the servers in this place not know anything about the food? What a wasted disappointment. And unfortunately, we can't agree with the Banana Cream Pie either....bake sale banana cream pie would've be comparable. \n\nWorst service that we have experienced in a very long time. To be housed at the great MGM Grand, I would've expected better. I think we would've had a better experience at the food court. \n\nThe food was passable.....not good...not great and definitely what I would've expected from Emeril. I'm not going to waste more time and energy by going on a continued rant but I will say that every minute I sat in Emeril's establishment was a waste of my life. \n\nThe BFF's two cents on the experience? \""Douchy bartenders, slow service, no eye contact, food was meh, banana cream pie lacked flavor-tasted nothing like cream and overpriced\"". Sums it up completely,	negative
They were a little slow tonight.  Most people do not need a review of this place, you have either eaten here or have been told to.  Only 1 other fast food burger in Vegas better than this one.	positive
I hate to be \""that person\"" that gives this place 2 stars. Finally made it here for their famed Sunday Jazz Brunch. Perfect time of year to sit outside and enjoy the weather, while brunching. Brunch is my favorite meal. Sit me outside overlooking a gorgeous golf course and waterfall, doesn't get any better.\n\nWe were greeted by our friendly waiter and drink orders taken. He explained that we have the choice of buffet style as well as some entree items to order. There were 4 of us so we decided to order a few items off the entree menu to share. \n\nEggs Versailles-these were ok, nothing special.\n\nWagyu Hot Dog- don't ask, we just figured, why not. Again, nothing special, it was just a hot dog.\n\nBread Pudding French Toast- I was most excited about this, but the bottom was hard as a rock. You should be able to eat french toast without using a knife. \n\nSo we moved onto the buffet station. We all started out with the crab legs. These were so salty, 3 bites in and i couldn't even finish a leg. My friend agreed. Either they boiled them with way too much salt in the water or they were frozen.\n\nI tried the Shrimp & Grits, these were my favorite item. They were really good.\n\nThe buffet station was really small. They had some Kumiai oysters, some peel and eat shrimp, ceviche as well as build your own bagel and lox. Some granola parfaits, as well as a small cheese/salami board. And a very small dessert area. I didn't take part in the carving station. \n\nFor $65 a person, I expected a lot more. At least better food. I don't need an enormous selection, but at least make the food offered taste good. \n\nThey do offer bottomless mimosas for $25.\n\nFor the Wynn, I was disappointed. I enjoyed the brunch at La Cave ten fold over this place.	negative
Ballet Arizona has certainly improved thanks to the Dane Anderson...what does\n interest me is he....a.gay man?  Inquiring minds want to know...& I dont know why its  such a big secret! ?Arent MOST guys in ballet? Is it ONLY me who is wondering?	positive
I was given a gift card for CafePino from a co-worker who just raved about the place. So I figured that I would give it a try.\n\nA warm Tuesday night, I found the place pretty much empty even though lots of people were milling around and heading to the movies.\n\nGrabbed a seat outside and cruised through the menu. I would not really call this place cheap by any means\n\nI ordered the Pizza Procuitto and where the flavor was nice, the Procuitto looked more like Canadian Bacon. It was not thin at all... When I asked the waiter if this was normal he said no... yet did not do anything to rectify the issue.\n\nI might give it another try... but only because I still have some money left on the gift card.	negative
We've been trying out Cosmo dog park for a few years now. We actually took a break for about a year, though, because the park was always so disgusting that one of my dogs was getting skin infections on his feet after each visit. We also had a ton of problems with smaller-dog owners not watching their dogs and being generally really stupid with their animals, endangering both their own dog and mine. More than once I had dogs who were unknown to me run straight for me and leap into my arms to escape being chased by a larger dog. Sad when the dogs come to me and not their owners!\n\nI did talk to the town parks people about the small-dog issue, kids playing in the lake with the dogs (eeeeewwwwww!) and other issues, and they told me about their plans for the park. They do now have the timid dog area in place and more trash bins. Since we now have a second, younger dog, we decided to try it again this past week. \n\nMy dogs really liked the exercise and playtime, but the park is still really gross with dog crap everywhere. I didn't see a single person other than me pick up after their dog the entire time we were there. The small dog area gets used and I didn't see many issues with the little ones, so that was positive. But I am very concerned about health problems; both of our dogs got major soapy baths when we got home from the park. The parvo outbreak is significant this year and I don't think we'll chance going back. \n\nI also don't think people should be bringing their little kids to the dog park- there was even at least one family there with a baby and NO DOG. One guy made a comment as I walked by that \""now she won't ever be afraid of dogs!\"" Some of the dogs were literally nearly as big as me, and I saw some near-stroller-misses and some scary things for the kids- you may as well leave your baby sitting in the middle of the running of the bulls. \n\nCosmo is rated the best dog park in the country, and it could really be that if it was clean and if people had more common sense. It's not the dogs that are the problem....	negative
They did a good job on my pedicure but me and my sister both got a manicure and hers was sloppy while mine was crooked on a few fingers. It cost me a fortune and took forever. Everyone was nice there but to me it just wasn't worth it to spend my hard earned money on crooked nails. To boot they had a sign out front saying $25 for a full set but then charged me and my sister 35-45 each.	negative
Unfortunately no matter if I go to the galleria or Fashion Show it is the worst costumer service.  I was looking at a 600.00 Michael Kors handbag (at Fashion Show) with 3 sales associates talking and they never even looked at me. The whole store was like this.I bought nothing. I went to another department store and spent my money there. It's been like this for years. Especially the Galleria. I'd like to give a customer service training class. My guess is no one would show up.	negative
Beer is good, strawberry margarita is delicious!! The jalape\u00f1o pretzel bites are an appetizer worth paying for!! Wish it wasn't just seasonal, they should have it all year round! Food was so yummy! Our server Brittany was so nice and helpful! Definitely a place I would visit again :)	positive

As I sit a the gate 3, Terminal 2, UA1507 PHX-SFO in the plane with a 90 minute \""SFO Flow Control\"" and \""Mechanical problem of rivets missing on the engine cone?!\""  delay, I write this review. \n\nSky Harbor used to be my home base for a couple of years. It is a remarkably good airport given the tremendous growth in the Valley of the Sun. \n\nThere are 3 terminals: \nTerminal 2, the smallest and oldest, (United, Continental, others)\nTerminal 3, next largest and oldest (Delta, Northwest and many others, including international flights)\nTerminal 4, newest and bigger than the others combined, dominated by SouthWest and US AIrways (formerly America West)\n\nFor locals, there are the West and East long term parking lots. You can park in the West and walk to Terminal 2; East is much larger with an annex and hi-rise, and closer to terminal 4, but you need to take the shuttles. To help you remember which is east and west, PHX names the shuttles Gecko, RoadRunner, and one other I can't remember! \n\nFor visitors, to get a round the sprawling valley, you need to rent a car. The recently added offsite Rental car Center is huge and well organized into 4 floors with different brands on each floor, and a lot of shuttle buses that are dedicated to each terminal. It is about 1 mile from the airport, but allow 10 minutes for shuttles and loading when you drop off your car. \n\nThey have recently upgraded Terminal 2, expanding the security area and remodeling the restaurant. Terminal 2 has little in the way of food and shops. Terminal 4, organized into 7 separate buildings of gates connected with long hallways and moving sidewalks, has more food and shopping choices, but not on the order of PDX, or DEN. Because of the sheer volume of flights, Term 4 can have a long security check-in line, so plan accordingly. \n\nIf you have questions, there are roaming information assistant volunteers, wearing blue sports coats and hats. Signage is decent and most monitors have been upgraded to flat screens. \n\nSky Harbor is located close to Tempe (ASU) and no too far from downtown PHX. The edge of Mesa and Scottsdale are about 5 miles away, but it is 20 or more miles from other parts of North Scottsdale, Deer Valley and North Phoenix. Overall, it is fairly well organized and a clean airport with a lot of flight options, especially on SouthWest or US Airways, who use it as a major hub. For other airlines with a smaller foothold, you have to often connect through LAX, DEN, SLC, ORD or SFO depending on your final destination.	positive
Culinary Dropout is a fun spot for dinner and drinks with a group of people.  Everyone loves the pretzels and fondue appetizer, though I find it overrated.  The house potato chips are impressive though!  \n\nIt never fails that someone will order the fried chicken, and I'm not sure why it's never been me.  This restaurant is good at comfort food... the meatloaf is worth trying, I've heard great things about the burger, and I love the kale and sweet potato salad.  \n\nSome of the speciality cocktails are pretty good, albeit overpriced.  I stick to some house wine and I'm never disappointed.  Like all Fox Restaurants, their iced tea is lovely.\n\nMake a reservation if you're coming on the weekend, so you avoid a wait.  Then kick back, enjoy some live music and good food in a lively astmosphere!	positive
Food was pretty good but the staff are a bunch of zombies walking around with absolutely no customer service let alone personality. Out bar tender Steven acted as if he was in hell and provided a borderline unpleasant experience do to how non personable he was.  Not to pick on Steven but this was a common trend with ALL the staff.... Not sure I'll come back again.  Try smiling guys!!!	negative
I really enjoy the vibe inside Giant Coffee.\nWide open, bright and airy space, with an attached boutique that is good for browsing before/after ordering coffee.\nI really enjoy the iced honey-vanilla latte. Great for someone who is not a fan of overly-strong coffee drinks. The baristas are always friendly and helpful.\nA great place to come and study. It seems the best place to hook up your laptop is on the south wall, where the cool space-agey desks are located. If you can get a seat there, you're in luck :)\nFresh flowers at each of the tables, always a highlight!\nParking is not an issue if you park across the street at CVS.\nMy only complaint? Stay open a little later! Phoenix needs late-night coffee hangout spots!	positive
This place is so close to home that I really want to like it but there are just too many reasons not to.\n\nAs another Yelper stated the decor is nice post remodel and that is as good as it gets here.\n\nChips and salsa were brought to the table quickly and when my wife requested HOT salsa it was brought out quickly as well.\n\nPlaced our order..... carne asada burrito for me, fish tacos for my wife. They must be rationing fish in the kitchen.  Two tiny pieces in each taco which didn't fill the corn tortilla end to end. No flavor and not hot.\n\nThe carne asada burrito was small and the tortilla was like a firm paste. The quantity of tortilla outweighed the amount of carne asada. The beans were almost warm which puzzled me because the plate was very hot.\n\nMy wife asked for additional chips which never arrived to our table.\n\nWe were never asked if we enjoyed our meal. Im guessing that the amount we left on our plates spoke for us.\n\n5:30 on a Saturday night and the place is at 30 - 40% occupancy. I am pretty sure I know why.\n\nWe will not be returning.	negative
I live just down Commonwealth and absolutely going to Common Market to get one of there deli sandwiches!  The Californian is my favorite.  They have a great wine and beer selection as well and have wine tastings and other events throughout the week!  Check 'em out!	positive
Loved the food and the atmosphere.\n\nSplit the Chicken Parm and Lemon Fresc with my girlfriend and it was absolutely delicious. I will definitely have to come back soon.	positive
Wir warteten gestern 45 min bis jemand die Bestellung aufnahm. In der Zeit kamen auf unser Winken vier Mitarbeiter an den Tisch, die uns alle erkl\u00e4rten, dass es nicht ihr Bereich sei. Beim Bezahlen ging es auch ewig. Ganz klar gibt es am gleichen Ort L\u00e4den mit besserem Service.	negative
Called in a takeout order tonight & the process of ordering and going in to pick up was quick and painless. I could see parking being an issue for some, but that's just how it is downtown. Due to the small size of this place, I would probably only call in orders, but it's a really cute place. \n\nThe food was good and something I would try again. The Sweet Home Alabama was spicier than I expected, which was nice, but not as cheesy as I'd hoped. My husband got the Great Balls of Fire and he thought that it was good and the meatballs had a nice kick to them.  \n\nAll in all, a good experience. As someone who lives and works downtown, it's nice to have a new place that isn't pizza and is quick and easy to get takeout from.	positive
The 4-star rating is because of the taste.\n\nPrice:  150% of what you'd expect to pay\n\nService:  Excellent.  the service staff is friendly, smiley, and seem glad you're there.\n\nTaste:  absolutely wonderful.  The sauce is sweeter than most.\n\nI've only gone to the location south of Tempe Marketplace, and it seems kind of industrial.  I can EASILY overlook something like that for a lower price, so I'm ready for lower prices.	positive
I have been eating Thai food since 1983 when I was living and working in the region for years. I really never get the kind of taste experience in the U.S. yet I have had a good deal of excellent Thai in the bay area and elsewhere. But this place is obviously a cut above the rest.\n\nThe special spicy beef salad is amazing......they take an already excellent Yum Neua dressing and add hoisin sauce to create a masterful dressing like none other. It was killer.\n\nThe spicy chicken wing appetizer was also as good as I have had. We are madly in love with the same dish at Bangkok House in Kona and yet we thought this was even better....the sauce was richer and more garlic. Also a killer dish.\n\nLastly was the pineapple fried rice which has curry powder added as a twist....something not normally done in Thailand. The dish was perfect and so tasty.........but it was small and for the money they should be using fresh pineapple not canned. But it was still good enough no need to complain and even the curry powder was a nice touch.\n\nOur waiter \""Tea\"" is fantastic, great sense of humor.......and knows his stuff. Tea, if you read this thanks again for the tip on the special beef salad.\n\nCannot wait to go back.	positive
This place is pretty good! I wanted something decently healthy, cheap, and quick so I decided to try Jason's Deli. I got the turkey wrap and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was! I also got the broccoli cheddar soup which was delicious. The menu has a wide variety of food items to choose from which is great. Only downside - it was kind of pricey considering the amount of food I got. The wrap was realllllly small and wouldn't have satisfied me if thats all I got. However, overall, it was pretty good! Recommended!	positive
Enjoyed it even more on our second trip! Think it will be among our go-to bookmarked spots! The two item combo with rice is only $5.99 and is plenty for one... We each get one with different items and share. Love the BBQ pork!!	positive
Probably one of the best JC Penney's that I've been in a while.\n\nVery clean, and the staff is very friendly.  Never any lines, and well stocked and situated.  I think that the only issue with this store is its location which is tucked back behind Sears Grand.   Took us a while to find the first time since there wasn't any signs to designate where it was.\n\nYou know as they say... location location location.\n\nOtherwise, the place is great!	positive
Got the carne asada Jr. Burrito, it was dank! Although, it does suck to pay extra for things that are supposed to be included already. But besides that, Los Tacos was a party in my mouth.	positive
Just stopped in for some pizza and was so surprised they had white slices. I've been in AZ for 3 years and always miss good New York pizza. I would say their pizza is close to small chain pizzerias if you want a good New York slice try garden pizza in Goodyear but if you want a close to New York small chain \""Mario's pizza\"" style pizza an need a white slice fix give Gus a try. Got a special surprise the chef made some tiramisu and let us try it. Absolutely fantastic	positive
This place is one of my favorite comic shops. I actually live closer to a different one, but I drive to chandler just to go to this one. I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.	positive
The wait time for an appointment is ridiculous. Been waiting over an hour and a half for my scheduled appointment time. These people do not value patients time	negative
I did not like this hotel at all. It's very old and not comforts in it. \nThe good thing is that it was cheap but at the time was like a room just to sleep! \nThere is no view at all and while you are in the Vegas it should not be those kind of rooms. \nWhen we came in to the room we just sow a trash cans and an a conditioner staff...!!!\nBut the Casino and staff were good and cute  ...it's was almost like we were in the animation movies...but inside the casino...	negative
Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.\n\nThe restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.	positive
Favorite sushi place in NV!  Price is reasonable and food is incredible!  I will eat there every time I go to Las Vegas.	positive
Absolutely A-1 coffee shop! Very comfortable, inviting place with a very homey feel to it; to the right of the counter there's some pretty cool art displayed on the wall, as well as bookshelves packed with many books to choose from if you want some good reading to go along with your coffee. The staff is fast, attentive, & as friendly as can be, & as far as the coffee? Not too sweet, not too rich, but a perfect balance of the two! Great selection, great prices, great staff, & just an overall awesome coffee shop! The flavor of the coffee alone is enough to keep you coming back for more, & the welcoming feel of the shop overall is just an added bonus! The only regret I have is that there isn't one a little closer to where we live, but it's honestly worth the minimal travel time. If you haven't tried Grouchy John's it's definitely worth your while to check it out & pay this coffee shop a visit!	positive
Have to agree; probably the worst place for \""seafood\"" around. And the corporate atmosphere reminds me of outback or chilis.... enough said.	negative
OUR ROOM WAS LEAKING WATER! We woke up @ 3am to the sound of water dripping on the floor. We called the front desk (took 5 minutes for someone to pick up) and the lady told us she will move us to another room. So we have to pack up all our stuff to move to another room. So where do we move at 3am in the morning, all the way to the end of the Tower.\n\nIt took us 5-6 minutes of walking just to reach it! And apparently the pyramid leaks water according to the bell boy that helped us move. They put us in a nice room (mold was on the ceiling, we were too tired to care), better then the one before but it was already 4 in the morning by the time we reached it and unpacked, and we were going to check out at 10 am.\n\nSo during check out, we ask the front desk if there is anything they can do for us, and this rude manager comes over who seems already mad at us for even asking such a thing. She yells \""we put you in a better room then the one you had before so in our view you have already been comp\"". But we were only in there for 4 hours and that was to sleep, we would have been fine with the same room we had before. We didn't ask for a better room, just one that wasn't leaking water! She didn't want to hear it and said she can't do anything for us except comp us a free buffet, ROFL wow thats it?\n\nWe sold out and took it, we were hungry and tired. So we get to the register of the buffet and they couldn't find our comp! I was like WTF, COME ON! The lady behind the register took our names and room number down and we finally got in for free (or so I thought). So a half  week later, back at my house I noticed on my back account a $40 change from Luxor, I WAS LIKE WTF!?!? I called and they charged me for my buffet! \n\nI WILL NEVER STAY IN THE LUXOR AGAIN! DO NOT BOOK A ROOM WITH THE LUXOR YOU WILL REGRET IT!	negative
Very expensive!!!\nSound and environment was OK.\n$22 for two tickets is just not worth it, I would rather watch a movie at home where it is also more comfortable.\nWe went on a Saturday night and most of the theater was empty, only 2 other people were in the theater/movie we watched, the parking lot was also less than half full while in the past it used to be full and hard to find a parking spot let alone by the door.\nThey need to drop the price by at least 50% before I would go back...	negative

If only you could give out 10 starts, i think i would still have to give this place 11!! :)\n\nI never knew shshi could be this good!!!! Located on Eastern and Coranado, next to Trader Joe's, this is the place to go for sushi and also a good time! The owner Eddie pratically lives there... I think he has a matterss in the back somewhere. He is ALWAYS there which is awesome cause that means you can go anyday you want at any time and you will have the best sushi chef there to create the most amazing fish you have ever had.\n\nThe rolls are inventive and delicious. Eddie needs to sign up for a \""how fast can you make sushi contest\"" cause im telling you he would totally WIN!! Almost before you can tell him what it is you want he is handing it to you! \n\nI feel that part of the sushi experience is sitting at the bar and talking with the sushi chef. I have to believe that Eddie agrees with that cause he is very charming and engaging... he makes you laugh and smile, and well... just feel welcomed!!!\n\nThis place is fairly new but has a major following already. Once you go there you are hooked! The 1st time we went there it was so delicious that i wanted to go back the next day! (That never happens) Im telling you i dreamed about this place (the Danny handroll & Princess Deana roll to be exact) and when i called my brother to tell him how much i loved it (he told me about it) and that i wanted to go back the next day he said \""yeah, i understand, we went 3 days in a row when we found it\"" which then kinda gave me the ok to go again the next day and not feel bad!! :) thanks bro! \n\nIf you dont want to go to the strip and you want some AMAZING susi-this is the place to go! Just make sure you dont already have dinner plans for the night after, cause i guarentee you that you will want to go back again!! \n\nThank you Eddie, for bring to Henderson the best sushi EVER!! You are the MAN!!!! \n\noh, and after writting this and thinking about it, im sure ill see you in a few hours.. lol \n\n(pictures posted)	positive
Craving a good burger and based on a co-workers advise decided to try out Blue 32 Sports Grill.\nWaitress was friendly and attentive. Since this was our first time here she explained how everything was fresh made on site. \n\nI always want an explanation of \""seasonings\"" as some are \""spicy\"" seasonings and I don't do spicy.\n\nThe onion rings were seasoned with both black pepper and cayenne pepper. The onion rings were evenly sliced and had a nice \""crunch\"" to them. After the 3rd onion ring they started really getting to \""hot\"" for me. I would suggest using the cayenne pepper as an add-in for those who like spicy foods. \n\nI also ordered the Blue 32 Steak Sandwich. I expected to get thinly sliced  Steak instead I got something that resembled hamburger cubed steak. \nThe mushrooms were not sliced but rather \""cubed\"" . The onions were also chopped up. It would have been nice to have the mushrooms and onions sliced up and caramelized together on the grill then tossed in with grilled STEAK and cheese mixed in (instead the cheese was \""blobbed\"" on\""\n\nI am a mom that loves to cook and has a family that loves to eat my cooking. When I go out to eat (doesn't matter where) I want to have something that I either don't cook at home or just blows me away and makes me want to try cooking it home with equal or better restaurant results.\n\nI will give Blue 32 another try and see if my taste buds are telling me what others are saying.	negative
I alwYs go to Umc but this time it was after 730 so they were closed... First thing is I called them to make sure they were contracted with my insurance they said yes....

They weren't it was an APN which is fine but diagnosed my daughter with noro virus just bcuz it was going around at the time anyways long story short they aren't contracted with health plan of Nevada I called their billing department and they told me they didn't know who they were contracted with but billed all insurance wth??? AnywAys now I'm stuck with a $300 bill from them for seeing an APN that did not give us any prescription next time I'm sticking to Umc they are awesome...

Jennifer, of Jehnuine Designs, does great work and is very professional. About a year ago she created a logo for my business.

I love all my carbs toasted. I would rather be late for work and take the time to toast my bagel than eat it untoasted. This place drew me in because all their subs are TOASTED. Toasted to perfection, served warm, with just a little bit of golden brown starting to appear on the bread. Mmmm....heaven. \n\nThis place has a fun vibe. Reggae music playing, really chill workers, plenty of seating inside. Their sandwiches come in 3 sizes 4 inches up to 12 inches. Nicely priced and a pretty extensive menu. \n\nI got the Kali Mist which was delicious. Had a bit of kick to it, nicely sauced. I hate dry sandwiches. Can't wait to come back and try all their subs. They have a fun selection of desserts  rice krispies but also captain crunch krispy bars, cinnamon toast crunch bars, and fruity pebble bars. \n\nSorry Jimmy John's, Which Wich, Firehouse Subs, Quizno's... every other sub place on state street I'm starting a love affair with Cheeba Hut.	positive
Was here about 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm on Mon/16 Dec with a few buddies for their Monday Night Football specials:\n- $1 drafts and they have a big draft beer selection (Blue Moon, etc)\n- 1/2 off their sushi rolls/etc, foods pretty good\n- Friendly staff/bartender\n- Nice decor with a fish tank in the center of the bar\nI'll be back for sure.	positive
I dig the melting pot, i mean, its fun. Fondue=fun. This was another  \""Yay my birthday is during restaurant week!\"" dinner for me. The cheeses, meat course and salad are good but lets be honest that dessert is where its at. Id get all 3 courses as dessert if i could.   A big pot of chocolate and then cheesecake, rise crispies, bananas, strawberries, red velvet cake and marshmallows all to dip into it. Heavenly is an understatement. \nI also dig that your in control of your own cooking times. So what if i cook my steak for 10 seconds...rare is good yo...\nGoing with a large group is smart. Then you can really sample a lot of the stuff on the menu. Our party had 8 peeps in it so we got 3 different cheeses, cooking styles and  chocolates. Service was aiiiiiight considering it was a large party, but it coulda been better. I normally wouldn't be able to afford more than one course here but at $30 for everything during restaurant week it's a hella great deal.	positive
Too much bad attitude, unprofessional, and mediocre results. Not to mention that most of the \""nail technicians\"" there cannot properly re-create the nail art that they up-sell. I had to remove \""art\"" and repaint my toenails. \n\nIt's ALMOST worth the $20. If it cost any more, I would never go there again.	negative
So this weekend my 2 cousins and I decided we wanted to get our hair and makeup done at Platinum Entourage. We made reservations for 6pm for three people, assuming that we were going to get our hair done @ 6pm and then proceed to makeup done. Well we come to find that there is only one makeup artist and we all get our hair and makeup done at different times.  Most companies I have gone to in Hollywood they normally will have enough staff members to fulfill the clients' need, and not try to \""flip-flop\"" (that's what prick called it) everyone around because they only have one makeup artist. According to the prick, they just \""flip-flop\"" everyone around regardless of the time you made your appointment, so if you made it at 6pm chances are you won't be seen till 6:45pm.  So not only was that the stupidest business model for a company to have if they specialize in doing hair and makeup but the customer service was garbage. They were sooooooo rude about the entire situation. The receptionist didn't want to take any responsibility for the mix up, and the other guy was a complete prick in the manner that he spoke to us. To make matters worse they screwed up on the type of appointments, and then accused us of calling and canceling one of the makeup appointments!!!! I agree mistakes happen ALL the time, at first I wasn't upset until the prick came over to speak to us.  The manner that they dealt with the entire situation was disgusting, unprofessional and ignorant. NOW I can't say anything about the makeup artist because well we didn't get anything done due to all the screw ups, however, my cousin got her hair done and well it was nothing impressive.	negative
I went here alone when I first moved to Pittsburgh. Maybe it would've been a better experience had I not been alone, but I go out alone a lot, and I've never felt as awkward as I did when I walked into Gooski's. Everyone turned to look at me as I came in the door, and their eyes followed me until I took a seat in a booth by myself (do I have something on my face?). I grabbed a beer, sat and drank it and decided to leave rather than stay. It didn't feel very friendly to me.. but maybe I'll give it a second chance, based on some of these other reviews.	negative
After a bad experience at our Favorite Restaurant Roca Akor in Scottsdale, we turned to Yelp and Roka's very capable manager Charles responded within an hour, invited us back and more than made it right.  We knew they had great food and now, thanks to Charles, we know they have great management.  We highly recommend it.	positive
I came here on a Saturday night in the summer around 930. They quoted us a wait time of 70 minutes. We had our hearts set on this place, so we said we'd wait. But the best part was that they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. This was awesome! We got to hang out in the casino and get drinks until our table was ready. Once we were seated we were shown the drink menu. The drinks all looked amazing. Unfortunately, I was the DD for the night. We ordered parmesan (sp?) truffle fries and they were AMAZING! No joke, the best fries I've ever had in my life. The burgers were absolutely delicious. They were cooked to perfection. I hardly ever order a burger medium, and get a burger medium. It's always too well done. But this was perfect. Two friends I was there with ordered their's medium rare and you could see that theirs were absolutely medium rare and noticeably different from my medium. My husband and I keep a list of our top 5 burger places (similar to 'the list' from Friends), and this place shot to the top. We also ordered the Oreo shake and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Sticky toffee pudding is one of my all time favorites, but it was not at all good here. The shake was good, but I wish they had a malt option. Still, the sub-par desserts weren't enough to detract from the 5 star rating. Also, the servers' outfits are absolutely hideous, truly the most unflattering ensemble I could imagine for a server, but that's my only real criticism, which is hardly relevant at all.	positive
I have to say that this all-you-can-eat sushi buffet wasn't too bad. The service and ambiance was definitely better than Sushimon, but when it comes down to quality, taste, and presentation....Sushimon wins the competition!\n\nIf you don't mind driving a bit off the strip, then come to this sushi place. It was only $22 for lunch when my friends and I went here on a Saturday.\n\nSorry, peeps...Sushimon is still better for me...	positive
Had breakfast here today and it was excellent! The server was fast,  & friendly. Food was hot, fresh and tasty. Will come back again and try the other menu items.	positive
Football is king at Towne Tavern, and the brother princes of hockey, basketball and baseball vie for the crown throughout the year. Their court is comprised of raucous crews of kids eating for free on Tuesday nights and rogue interlopers consuming regular drink specials. Their lovely pedestal-seated princess is the most glorious ranch dressing in all of the land, who is often attacked by guerilla French fries who want her all to themselves.\n\nDecorated in traditional sports bar regalia, but focusing on the far away upstate New York and neighboring New England teams, Towne Tavern has a visible love for the refugees of cruelly cold winters. They come to Towne Tavern to eat, drink and reminisce about their homeland, and cheer for the Carolina teams on the side.\n\nTowne Tavern's menu is highlighted by their burgers and sandwiches, and their surprising level of quality salads, which are high in dark green lettuce content rather than iceberg, as many restaurants of that plane push.\n\nService is inconsistent at TT at times; however, not such that it stops us from eating there.  Takeout orders sometimes take longer than they should to appear; so much so that it has occurred to me to wonder if it is done purposely so that those waiting at the bar for meals to go will order another beer.\n\nOverall, it is a solid place to eat, and is a staple restaurant in Fort Mill for upstate New York transplants and natives alike.	positive
This is the the most dishonest car shop I have ever been to, utterly disgusted at the conduct and lack of ethics of the employees who work here.\n\nA few weeks ago I noticed that two of the tail lights on my Acura were out. I took it in Midas as they were the closest shop and knew they were open on Sundays. The window signage stated clearly: free estimates. After waiting for nearly an hour, the technician informed me that since it was an electrical problem, they would have to charge me a diagnostic fee of $75 despite the window stating the contrary.\n\nAfter complaining about why did they didn't tell me this an hour ago, they went ahead and honored their policy. They told me that for whatever reason, the 'light switch' went out and had to be replaced at a cost of around $200. I was about to agree to the repairs, until a woman walked in the lobby complaining about her car overheating again despite having it brought in to this shop 3 times and paying each time.\n\nThis was enough to turn me off to the repairs and I ultimately drove home, tail lights still malfunctioning. After speaking to my friends, they recommended I check out Hondatronics (see my review for them). I took my car down there the next day and informed the lady working there of the problem, I even mentioned that Midas had told me that the light switch had to be replaced. About an hour later, I got a call back from Hondatronic stating that they had fixed the problem: 2 bulbs which had blown. Total cost: $15. \n\nTHANK GOD I DID NOT LET MIDAS DO ANY REPAIRS ON MY CAR. I don't know how they were talking about replacing some part for $200 when all they had to do was replace 2 bulbs. I can't believe this place is still in business. Judging by the other reviews here, its clear that ripping people off is the way this shady shop makes their money. Save your money, time, and go somewhere else.	negative
We purchased a living social deal for $139 which was said to include a one nights stay in a king size suite, a $28 breakfast, and a $50 spa credit. However, the breakfast cost more than $28 and was basically disgusting. The toast had the burnt parts scraped off. No joke! For $36 we got burnt toast and greasy eggs. The waiters had NO IDEA what they were doing or what they had. Every question I asked was met with an, \""I'm not sure,\"" or the wrong answer. \n\nThe dinner, which cost us over $100, was mediocre at best. The highlight of our $30 steaks was the mashed potatoes, which didn't even come with it, we had to pay for it as a side. The waiter didn't know how much wine came in a wine glass. He guessed it was a 4oz pour. I'm having a $100 dinner, and your waiter doesn't know how big of a pour you have for your wine? Isn't that like training 101? And to top it all off, I left my sunglasses at the table (we were the ONLY table there with the exception of the family sitting 4 tables away) and of course they \""hadn't seen them,\"" when we came back.\n\nSo come to find out, the spa credit for $50 covers half of a pathetic massage. My fiance gives me better massages and they are free.\n\nI liked that the room was clean, and the water park was fun. However they charged my account for everything, and my fiances account for everything. They also double charged my account for the spa visit. So all in all, our $139 turned into over $900. So be weary when going to this resort.	negative
Lulu is probably our favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  The ambiance is truly perfect - white tablecloths and very attentive servers perfect for a romantic evening but still casual enough for a family or group of friends.  Brunch is not too be missed. Mussels and frites are awesome. We once had an overcooked steak but it was recooked without question. Everything else we've ever had at Lulu has been outstanding. And the owner and staff go above and beyond to make sure that all of their customers are enjoying themselves. I love it at Lulu.	positive
I stayed at the Wynn for four nights last week.  It was my first and last time staying at this hotel.  First off, it is a very beautiful and classy place with an awesome buffet.  However I think all this disguises the underlying problems this hotel has: convenience and a quiet night's stay.\n\nI go to Vegas often and have stayed at many different hotels on the strip including Encore.  Checking-in never took longer than 5 minutes at the other hotels except at the Wynn which took 40 minutes.  Yeah, ok it was busy but Vegas always is when there's a convention in town which is basically every day.\n\nThe first night what I thought was the TI pirate show turned out to be the window panes hitting each other because of the wind.  Keep in mind it was not that windy.  It was more so just breezy.  I was wondering why I was hearing such loud noise every couple minutes.  You would think for such a ritsy, expensive hotel this wouldn't happen, but it's definitely the case at the Wynn and from what I remember the Encore as well.  Not a big deal if you are out all night partying.  But when you gotta get up early the next morning because you are on a business trip it's not a good thing.\n\nWhen it came time for me to leave and check-out they don't even have the convenience of checking out on the TV.  Anyways, I needed a statement copy so I went to registration to check-out.  Another 20 minutes wasted.  While I was waiting in line I overheard one of the workers tell a guest who was checking out that he was 13 minutes past check-out time.  Common now!  How dare he even say that to a guest and on top of that it was because the F@#$king line moved so damn slow!\n\nWhen it was finally my turn to check-out they messed up on my bill.  Turns out they never took down my credit card information, which I provided them when I checked in and charged everything to the saved company corporate card on file.  I told them all charges needed to be on my own credit card due to my company's policy.  She didn't understand or know what to do so she had to grab a coworker to help her out who also didn't understand the situation.  This is understandable because how can a confused person properly tell another what the situation was without confusing her?\n\nAfter some time they finally fixed the problem and I was out of there.  Never to return again.  I don't know if the convenience of quick checking-in and out is due to there computer system or just incompetence.  I don't care for finding out.  All I know is I completely discourage people from staying at this hotel.	negative
We went here on Wed for my grandson's birthday.  We got there about 8 pm and it was sort of busy, and mariaches were singing. The waitress didn't speak English and we had questions about some menu items which were in Spanish. It took us awhile to order due to the language barrier [two dishes were described exactly the same in different sections w/different prices, and other issues] and her serving other tables. By that time, the place had totally cleared out, including the music. My son and his wife got their shrimp burro meals fairly fast, then quite awhile later when they were finished, my grandson got his bacon-wrapped shrimp [he wasn't hungry any more from eating chips, etc], and then 15-20 minutes later, I got my \""seafood stuffed fish\"" [ I guess seafood means only \""shrimp\"" and veggies on top]. It took over an hour for my fiancee to get his Zarande Ado Relleno [grilled whole fish w/veggies on top] and I had to request his side of tortillas that were to come with it. He had been sharing my food and eating lots of chips, salsa and ceviche because he was starving, so wasn't hungry any more. He took a couple of bites of his meal and packed it to go [as did my Grandson]--we had to leave because he gets up very early for work, and it was after 9:30. On a positive note, the salsa was one of the best I've ever had [would like to get the recipe], and that along with the chips and ceviche [nice perk], and Margaritas(!) saved us while waiting for our food. However, although servings were generous the seafood did not have much flavor, was overcooked and a disappointment after reading some of the glowing reviews. It was not the waitress's fault the food took so long and she comped us on a round of drinks while we waited for the last two plates. Otherwise, she was fairly attentive, but it was very frustrating trying to communicate with her, only speaking muy poquito Espanol and using hand gestures. She did apologize, and I was sorry it was a negative experience because we were there to \""celebrate\"" a birthday.	negative
Dear Papago,\n\nI love you.  And I love your orange blossom beer.  The pizza is pretty fabulous too.  And I live really far away so coming here is a special treat.  But you blew it last night.\n\nThe server warned us in advance that they were understaffed and thing might be a little slow. No problem.  We ordered beer and beer bites.  I actually wanted pizza but thought it would take too long.  The beer arrived pronto.  One hour later, no beer bites and we had to leave.  The table next to us were noshing happily on their appetizer AND pizza.  I considered starting a bar fight just to steal a slice.  The waiter was super nice but I did not for one second buy his line about the beer bites taking forever.  You can cook an entire pizza more quickly than little bites of dough?  Do I look stupid?  If you lost my order, say so rather than insulting my basic knowledge of chemistry.\n\nI will probably be back but I think we need some time apart. \n\nLove,\nHungry Girl	negative
Gigi's has focused it's efforts on only the superficial.  Their marketing materials (signage, brochures, packaging, etc.) are slick and glossy.  That's appropriate for this type of business, but what about focusing on the core if what it's supposed to do --- making great cupcakes?  And having a wide selection from which to choose?\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon I stopped in, there where six cupcakes.  Not six varieties, but six ACTUAL cupcakes!  I can understand the need to avoid waste and shrinkage, but six???  They're made of flour and water!!!  How much can it cost to keep a variety on hand?\n\nIn terms of the product, the cake was just average and the frosting was too thick and sweet.  The good news?  It was pretty to look at and well-packaged.	negative
Probably the best show we've seen so far! It's really worth it, nice theater built especially for this and the show is amazing! Try to not seat in the first 3 rows, you'll get wet. You can get drinks and popcorn, but they are pretty expensive.	positive
Dr. Amy is the BEST! She made me feel like family and took care of me and my dental situation. I did not go out of there in tears like my last dentist. Her front office staff Karla was understanding and very helpful.\nThank you Dr. Amy and your staff for making me feel so comfortable and welcome.	positive
I've been here a few times and let me tell you it's been a great experience in every visit, one of my two favorite appetizers is the nachos with carne Asada and the chorizo with queso, I could just keep coming back for these two,along with a beer at their newly added bar which by the way the variety it's pretty awesome, they have all kinds of tequilas you just wanna try them all haha! I'm sure they won't have a problem with that!,they also have a patio with a mister system which I haven't personally been into just yet because I've been there during the winter but that's the one feature I'm looking forward to go to during the summer; over all I thing it's a great place  to go and enjoy a nice meal with familly or friends, I will definitely come back!!	positive
We've started making Eddie's House a regular friday routine. Tonight he had Lebanese specials made by his mama. The stuffed squash and green beans in tomato sauce were awesome. My kids swear by the mac and cheese and they love the spices on the flatbread.	positive
This is my home course. I play here about 75 times a year. Recently they had a management change. For some reason  they forgot about the golfers who supported them when times were tough. The changes that they are making are great for the course. Just remember the local guys are the one replacing divots, spending money in the restaurant and making a effort to support you guys even when you burn the greens or the fairways on 13. If you keep up your changes, the locals we will find another place to play. Now with that being said the course is playing well. There has been some new ways of keeping the course in good condition. They are mowing early and raking the bunkers. This has helped them  become more consistent. The layout is fair for every golfer. There's not much trouble and even errant shots are forgiven by desert surrounds and lack of trees. Take your wedges because it is generally driver,short iron wedge type course. The front has a little water but bring your gas mask. All in all I would rate Rhodes a 5 out if 10. Worth at the most for 18 holes $30 to $45 a round. A great practice course at best. Lessons are great and are complementary for players club on Saturday with Alex (no longer with this course on the time it took to post this review)He is great with kids. Steer clear of Don or anyone who came from Tuscany. They are full of themselves. I am a resident of Rhodes Ranch and I am very disappointed with the last 4-6 months. Arnold Palmer would not be proud.	negative
I am genuinely the most easiest person to please. I always drove past this location and asked myself, \""Why have I NOT tried this place yet?\"" \n \nWe stood in line waiting to order and there was this elderly women in front of us who obviously was trying her best to take an order being it was her first time too, the cashier lady immediately got frustrated and scold the lady to pick up the tone of her voice because she couldn't hear her order.  \nIf that wasn't rude enough a drive thru asked for her assistants and she snapped at them telling them that she's occupied, \""Hold Up!\""\n\nThen it was my turn to order. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and did my best to order... I decided on a medium burger, and she rudely told me... \""you mean the beef medium burger?\"" Long story short because I don't want to write an essay...\n\nIf she didn't love her job find a new one... or if she was having a bad day? Take a moment to go and breath. There should be no reason for her to mistreat her guest. Especially when you never know who that guest could be. \n\nFood came out, we noticed she missed a lot of things we requested.... disappointed because the food was actually tastey.	negative
They have great pizza and now have a new menu.  I tried the Lasagna and being Italian I never ate one better than mine until I had their's.  I had to tell the chef.  They also have a stracciatella soup which is an egg drop soup (not on the menu) and it is delicious.  The other friends I was with loved the meals they ordered	positive
The hotel is small but yet very new and comfortable. I loved how clean it was and their customer service is amazingly good. They have a free shuttle to and from the strip and the airport too. I would definitely stay here again. I only paid $210.00 from September 3rd to the 6th. Cristian, one of their staff members, was amazing. He was always on top of everything and always willing to help. I loved the fact that although their staff was young, they were always happy, smiling and willing to help. Excellent work guys.	positive
How stupid are the supervisors of this airport? They have small shuttles to get you between terminals. The shuttles are very small buses that can not accommodate luggage. People who have to transfer from international to domestic usually have to grab their luggage and take it themselves. So no room in the shuttles. It is too far to walk. Stupid ignorant cheap supervisors. I can only assume that all the big buses were taken. Do us a favor and do something about that.	negative
If you want a fast but good burger that doesn't break the bank, leaving u money for other fun things! Really nice employees too!	positive
Read the reviews and couldn't wait to try this place.. that was my first mistake, I should have waited a long LONG time ;)\n\nFirstly, the restaurant is located in a small strip mall with some funky parking.  Went in, was impressed with the cleanliness and it certainly smelled wonderful.  Hubby was hungry, so he ordered the chips and dip, 2 garlic rolls, and a large pizza.. I quickly changed it to a small pizza, and I'm doubly glad that I did.\n\nChips and dip arrived - hubby thought they were both fantastic.  I thought they were good, but hardly \""life altering\"".  The chips are homemade, no salt on them, and fried until hard.  They're too thick to be called crispy.  The dip was called Ranch and it was all you tasted.. Ranch dressing.  If there were other seasonings in there, they were lost.\n\nThen the pizza arrived, and we reminded the guy about our garlic rolls.  He quickly returned with 2 foil wrapped rolls.  Hubby opened his and tasted it immediately.. then set it down and never picked it up again.  He said it was cold and boring, so I didn't open mine at all - not going to waste time on something that bad.\n\nThe pizza toppings were fresh and the crust was crispy.  Not thin, not thick, but sturdy.  However, the sauce had virtually no seasonings to it - a frozen pizza generally has more flavor than this did.  There was a shaker of oregano and another of garlic located with the shakers of pepper flakes and dried parmesan cheese.. once those were added, then it was okay.  I have serious issues with a pizza that has to be seasoned afterwards.. isn't that the cook's job?\n\nI had one slice, hubby had two.. and we tossed half the small pizza as not worth saving.\n\nOn a plus note, the fountain coke tasted great ;)	negative
I've had a lot of things both dry cleaned and altered at this place (several hundred dollars worth). He is consistently late and there were a  couple of instances where I had to take stuff back to be re-done. I've only gone because it is convenient to my location and reasonably priced. I will never go back though. The straw that broke the camels back for me was the most recent time when I had him alter two suits. We agreed on two weeks to complete the work. I came back in three and he hadn't even started. He told me the earliest he could do it was another week and then was late again. Seriously? How hard is this? I am now going to start a search for a more reliable place.	negative
This was the best buffet we ate at on our trip to vegas. the dessert bar was awesome here.	positive
WHOO HOO! Came to visit from out of town and was looking for something to do. Consulted \""the yelp\"" and found out about this place. Checked the website and found out there were Church Bus races that night. SOLD!\n\nThis was my first time doing anything like this and it was fantastic! We paid $7 each for entry, plus we did it up and got ourselves some Bud tallboys to complete the experience. The engines were loud, the crowd was rowdy, and the bathrooms were clean. What else could you want out of your night?	positive
I guess this would be an okay place to eat if you're leaving the Social Security office down the block and are literally about to die of old age and want to have one last gyros sandwich before you go. But otherwise, meh.\n\nWe had lunch here and it was unremarkable. A Greek salad and gyros sandwich were both without any standout features. French fries were obviously from a bag, frozen. Not worth the calories. The sandwich had too much lettuce and not enough onion on the gyros sandwich, so it was bland, and tomato diced, and on top, which made the sandwich unnecessarily messy.\n\nThe service was friendly and the dining room was bright, spacious and sunny - and the presence of a coffee bar is definitely a plus - but I won't be back.	negative
After reading my review the owner Dave contacted me. He was very professional and apologetic about what had happened and refunded my deposit. He didn't try to convince me that I was wrong but simply admitted that what had happened was unacceptable. It's not often that you get this kind of follow up service from any business so big props to Dave.	positive
Love that it's open 24 hours perfect for when we're craving donuts which Is often. I feel that if I wasn't allergic to milk we'd be coming here more often	positive
The food is great poblano chicken sandwhich great taste. Beer is cold!!! So here is my best advice try the place BEER IS COLD, Great atmosphere, girls are beautiful. But, it's the food you come for!! Remember this if the food isn't right service is sub par ask for a manager. Justin thanks for asking me to stay for the food!! Jamie you were great!!!!!	positive
My hubby and I are picky about our sushi. Many claim to be sushi spots, but they lack the culture that we look for in a sushi restaurant. Some chains have tried to make sushi hip, cool, and corporate,by pushing out the culture that invented it in the first place. Atami is authentic, JAPANESE, sushi, and it is oh so tasty, and reasonably priced. The spot is owned by a friendly Japanese couple. The husband handles the sushi right behind the sushi bar. \n\nLOCATION\nThis spot is a hole in the wall location right next to a SUBWAY and some independent businesses. Boo on you if you let the location deter you, and you chicken out and you opt for SUBWAY! Where is your sense of adventure? You are missing out. Some of the best food comes from these types of locations.\n\nRESTAURANT\nBefore you walk in, you'll see their \""A\"" Grade proudly posted in their window for everyone to see. An \""A\"" Grade is more than enough reason to set my foot in the door!!! It is very neat and clean. The restaurant is tiny. It is sit down, or take out. It has a sushi bar where you can see how your food is prepped. It also has booths and tables.\n\nFOOD\n\nYou can order sushi and other Asian dishes from the menu, and they are reasonably price. This is not an easy find. Sushi is often overpriced. One of the highlights of this location is the Bento Special. The Bento Special includes your choice of an entree that comes with soup, rice, 4 California Roll pieces, and a Spring Roll for 6.99. You can tack on their 2 sushi roll combo for an additional $7. The food is fresh and is served on something that is not your traditional white plate. At this location presentation matters.\n\nThe menu is nice, but the highlight of this location is the sushi. The sushi is the first thing that you should try. I heart Atami and you should too!!!! Support this local business YELPERS. This place needs to be around because it is legit, and it is oh so tasty.	positive
This review has to do with just trying to give STK business.  I've being trying to reach them for 2 days to book a private room for 12 people.   When restaurants are hot and booked every night they think they are untouchable.  This attitude/arrogance is pathetic!  They will not always be on top and when their appeal declines people will remember how they were treated.  Good Luck STK!	negative
Great tasting sweet potato fries. Music is way too loud. Burger is large but very greasy. Bun was greasy, and double patty fat had soaked into bun. Way over priced at $11.50.  Next time it's McDonalds!	negative
By far the best rendition of NY Style pizza in Charlotte.  This was our first visit and we will definitely be back. Although we live closer to the Ballantyne we will go there next week. \n\nWe just had a pizza with bacon and it was perfect.  They use good cheese,  an excellent sauce and perfectly crumbled bacon. \n\nGood atmosphere for kids too n	positive
As a local, it would make ZERO sense for me to go to Planet Hollywood for a sandwich. So my 5 star rating shouldn't be misconstrued as me saying I would frequent them all the time, but rather based on convenience and price compared to what you typically find in a Las Vegas casino. At $6 you would be hard pressed to find a better sandwich on the Vegas strip. Is it the best sandwich I have ever had? Certainly not. However, with warm bread, tasty meat and relatively quick service... you can't beat Earl of Sandwich. Added bonus is that it is directly across from the Sports Book... grab a sandwich and go sit and watch a game. \nI agree with Misti that they have a major lack of options for not only bread but toppings and sauces. No oil and vinegar? How does a sandwich shop not have oil and vinegar?\nSandwich is not overly filling, which could be either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Heading to see Peepshow? Probably don't want to sit through that on an overstuffed stomach! Grab some Earl and you will be good to go!\nI order the Full Montague (I believe) which has turkey and roast beef. Consistently good and they have not messed up an order of mine yet.	positive
Wow what a cool place. Inside you'll find a vast selection from all over the world of imported olive oils, vinegars, pesto, tapenades, appetizers, marinades, sauces, dressings, mustards, specialty salts, exotic herb mixes and much more. They also have several handcrafted ceramics and culinary accessories to make you feel like you are the King or Queen of the kitchen.\n\nThe friendly staff here is extremely knowledgeable and more than happy to share what they know. History of the product, how it is made, cooking tips, as well as providing a giant array of tasty items to sample. We tried several of the oils along with all the yummy vinegars on their display table. They even have spicy HOT sauces. Nice!\n\nHad to get a bottle of the fantabulous Cherry Almond Balsamic Vinegar that we all enjoyed while sampling. They say you can even put it on Cheese Cake or Ice Cream.\n\nThey also offer custom labels personalized for your special occasion such as weddings, corporate events, employee appreciation, etc. Hmmm?\n\nDefinitely plan on coming back again. YES!\n\n4.5 STARS	positive
Today at around 3:30 PM, i walked into this store where they were about 10 partons in the store. One of the clerks said \""Hi, hows it going today\"", i said 'fine, but i'm about to get busy'. He notices my recently rescued puppy sitting in my car. He then yells out that he can see the heat rising over my dog's head, then this clerk says he (or someone) is going to break out my car windows\""??? I replied 'that i'm going to break you\"" and some other words if he does that. By then i'm angry, or maybe embarrassed, since my car windows were down ...and i had a friend in the car with her, as well, and i'm only in that store for maybe 5 minutes. I'm angry because this is the 2nd time this clerk has made a comment that's pretty hostile about my dog, so this time i wanted to talk to him about how this makes me feel. The other clerk,  Robert Vassos, then begins to YELL at the top of his voice at me about wanting to address this clerk (all i said to that clerk was \""you hurt my feelings\"") while he pushes him away, he's telling me to leave the store,, don't come back and a few other nasty words. I remained calm but i flipped him off and licked my tongue out at him (i know, very childish) with a smile on my face as i exited the store, not sure what else i said before that moment. He thens runs behind me yelling out the door \""screw you and your dog!!\""??  I flipped him off again, something i NEVER, EVER do, even in traffic, or at anyone, for that matter but i needed to fight back at this point since both of them had become hostile towards me by then??\n\n I'm a 4th generation Nevadan Grandpa worked on Boulder Dam, my dad owned packaged liquors in the Midwest after his years as a professional football player. I've never seen such crazy hostile reactions being it was their clerk that started this with me by making threats about vandalizing my car when i walked into their store? The reasons i became so concerned now was that the other many patrons might decide to attack me or my car, thinking i was doing what he had accused me of doing to my puppy?? I'm a hybrid driving vegan that lives a sustainable lifestyle but i dont run around in grocery stores YELLING at customers because they choose to eat meat or drive gas guzzling cars,, yet this clerk is yelling at me about my furrychild based on paranoid delusions?? \n\n In the past, all the other clerks have been extremely nice but this clerk needs reevaluation and should keep his hostile, paranoid thoughts to himself; that manager needs anger management before he hurts someone. thank you!	negative
So what's the big deal here and, based on the experiences I've had coupled with a lot of the other Yelp reviews I've read, how are they still open?\n\nCute decor? Definitely. Funky?  Certainly. Hip? I suppose. All that does not a restaurant destination make though.\n\nThe food sounds nice on the menu and the fact they are supporting local farms and growers is appreciated but the results are just so uneven. It tastes good but it's cold, it's hot but overcooked, it's hot and cooked properly but really doesn't taste quite right. It's perfectly prepared and delicious. Who can tell?\n\nAdd to that the fact that the front of the place is a disorganized mess and the staff is either surly or outright rude and condescending and I get back to my original sentiment. How is this place still open?	negative
Although I like the concept of the place, it was seriously lacking in customer service.  In addition, the bartenders don't even know enough to tell you what different types of beer they have.  I don't care what your selling, you should at least have some knowledge about your product.	negative
Worst Sprint store in town. Their staff are theives and the managers cover up for them. I'm currently disputing  fraudulent charges from this store. No one wants to take responsibility and I'm out 500$ \n\nHorrible customer service and untrained staff. \n\nI proved one of their sales people stole from me and threw manager did nothing!\n\nI'm also reporting this store to the BBB.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE!	negative
I have been going to this office for a few years, and for some reason I have never thought to review them on yelp. Weird.\n\nAnyway, the front office staff is friendly enough. I can usually get an appointment within a day or 2. I was unique with some of the paperwork I had to provide for my school, and the office was always extremely accomodating with short notice or allowing me to pick up a note without an appointment, or just calling up and explaining what the school needed and they would call me when it was readt, etc etc\n\nI recommend Dr. Whipple. He is super nice. He spends time with you to answer all your questions. And, being a nurse, I find him thorough. There have, also, been a few times where I asked for a certain test to be done, and he will order it.\n\nI, also, like that there are some things done onsite, which is convenient...such as X-rays and ultrasounds.\n\nThe negatives for me are they weigh you in the hallways out in front of everyone. And, I just feel like, for a lot of people, this might be something they want to keep private. They, also, close early on Fridays...I think at 3:30p.\n\nAlso, the last time I was there I left a class an hour early so I would be on time and arrived at 3:15 for a 3:30 appointment. I did not get called to the exam room until 4:30. Then I waited another 30 minutes for the doctor to actually see me. I didn't end up leaving until 5:30. I had to cancel dinner reservations for 6:30 because of this. And, NO ONE apologized. Totally unacceptable. I was beyond irritated. What was weird is there were only  of us waiting to be seen by various docs...so it wasn't like they were crazy busy.\n\nLastly, pray you never need your medical records because Jacqueline in that department will do everything in her power to not give them to you. I called on April 1st and faxed my signed request. I got no response for a week, so I called to get a status update. I was told my request was never received even though I had my successful fax confirmation. I refaxed my request on April 22 then called to confirm it was received. I tried explaining that I was working with a deadline from my insurance company, and because my 1st request allegedly wasn't received, now I had even less time. For whatever reason, this passed Jacqueline off. I honestly can't think of another instances where someone was this mean on the phone...seemingly for no reason. It was indicated to me in so many words, that because she could make me wait, she would make me wait. As of May 13...still no records. Thanks, Jacqueline!!	negative
I was also in the group of four from the below review. The service was beyond absurd. Ordering four drinks in a pub that is moderately busy shouldn't take over half an hour. Our 'waitress' took 15 minutes of that to even come and greet the table. \n\nAfter ordering we sat and watched new customers come in and sit at the bar, promptly receiving service and drinks. All the while, our waitress would stand at the bar and drink her own drink, watch the football game or just completely disappear into the back. At first, I thought she was waiting on the bar, but the bartender wasn't busy, as he spent most of his time standing and talking. \n\nFinally our drinks came. The whiskey was an issue, plus the cider was flat and tasted horrible. Alas, the waitress was nowhere to be seen for over 10 minutes and by the time she re-appeared, we were ready for our bill and wanted to leave.\n\nThe staff here seems to be lacking training and some sort of management. I can't believe a table of four, who would have stayed for more drinks, can't get more than one round in 45 minutes. The entire staff seemed more interested in socializing with each other and watching tv than any kind of service.\n\nIf I'm going to spend 8.50 on a beer, I'll be going somewhere that I can at least get more than one, and won't taste like the keg isn't cold and a couple months past it's expiry.	negative
I just came back from here. The drive thru was crazy, of course because of the time (1130). \n\nThere was a young employee setting up an umbrella and a sign. He was the ONLY one who was nice, which you would think, in this heat, he would be a little snappy.\n\nThe other two employees I greeted, said \""hello\"" to, asked them how they were. No response.\n\nUnreal. But my order was right.	negative
Previously known as Imperial Palace is good because of its location on the strip. Smacked in the center and cheap. But, you get what you're paying for, and sometimes less. I've stayed here many times because of comp rooms and because it's just convenient. Here's what I've learned:\n\n(1) self-parking is a pain. People take up 2 spots and do not even pay attention to the lines. On top of that, the spots are all compact. If you drive a big car, don't bother. Your options? Valet or park at Harrah's. Harrah has a walkway over to The Quad from the parking structure and there's much more spaces at Harrah's parking lot.\n\n(2) Front desk ALWAYS has a line. Be ready to wait to check-in. As for checking out, do it from the TV. Save you time from standing in line again.\n\n(3) Always ask for a room in the lowest floor possible. Elevator here is a drag. Better off taking the stairs.\n\n(4) NEVER stay in Tower 5. This is right next to the Outdoor club and music will be blasting!\n\n(5) $5 blackjack tables are available early morning and ends around 10AM. \n\nAnd that's 5 things you need to know about Imperial.. I mean The Quad, folks!	negative
Although this place has the friendliest staff I've encountered at a barber shop, the cut I received was short of okay!  Great friendly atmosphere and some funny barbers to chat with.  Unfortunately, I do not see myself returning due to a not so nice haircut and a price that shocked me when I reached the register to pay.	negative
Food is wonderful but staff was very rude!\nI got pastrami it was made perfect!  Tried the original also great! And so was tomato soup	positive
Music is too loud (obnoxious) and the internet sucks, slow. I love Starbucks but at night this more like a nightclub, but you know without the people. Currently using my phone to tether just to do the homework I can barely do because it is so friggin loud here. But this is just the humble opinion of one gold card holder.	negative
Lol I am doing a M****F*****G review on Denny's seriously! Well my EX has ties to this location so he feeds me on his dime. This is the spot when I want breakfast for dinner. I always order the same, an Ultimate omelet no mushrooms, hashed browns, and a bagel w/cream cheese. Um WTF they do not have a Denver omelet on the menu. Who in the world does not have the capability to make a Denver omelet. We are talking ham, bell pepper and onion.\n\nWhy not you may ask??? Well rumor has it that to cut cost, they did away with fresh vegetables such as bell pepper. They replaced it with a fajita style bell pepper and onion mix which comes in frozen. They use it for everything now, in 5 or 6 of their menu items. So there is no way to make a Denver because it would taste funky with that crappy seasoned pepper and onion mix (frozen). \n\n\n\nAnyhow, I like the free entertainment this location provides! The more low end clientele, homeless, prostitutes, and idiot and ungrateful demanding hotel staff management whom holds their weekly pow wow here. This Denny's is located inside of a motel and casino for the record.\n\nJust getting from your car to the building is an erotica of funk. Always some prostitute yelling at another, and the \""women of the night\"" switching shifts on the corner!\n\nI really feel good about myself as I am walking into the casino to the inside Denny's.\nI said Denny's is horrible, but not as bad as those call girls just on the other side of the door.\n\nThe one redeeming quality in this location is that they do have Awesome music bumping every time. I am always doing the booty mix a lot sway in the booth! Lol I do I really do. Then I get hit on by a pimp in which I told to take his baby nuts a walkin before they get let a stompin!	negative
I was introduced to Fat Daddys Ice Cream at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest, and in the blazing heat of a mid-afternoon sun it was a welcome introduction.  Here is served old fashioned scooped ice cream, and the scoops are quite generous, and prices reasonable.  In fact, a dollar can be saved by combining two scoops in one cup instead of ordering two single scoops separately.  Right on the food truck window where one orders, the scoops are described as \""Big\"" and \""Fat\"", as in \""2 Big Fat Scoops,\"" and the company stands behind its words.  The scoops were both massive--all the better to beat the heat!  \n\nAnd the ice cream was delicious.  The Rocky Road Ice Cream was smooth and creamy, and just chockfull of nuts and large marshmallow pieces as one would expect to be authentic Rocky Road.  Although the accompanying large scoop of Butter Pecan Ice Cream was not notably creamy, its flavor was true Butter Pecan, and the pecans were numerous and really tasty.\n\nAnother unusual touch for a food truck that I appreciated was that ice cream orders were prepared right after ordering and paying.  So that I observed a Fat Daddys employee scoop out my desired ice cream by hand and sequentially place both scoops into a Styrofoam cup before handing the completed order to me within a minute as I stood at the window.  Great, quick service!  \n\nKudos for Fat Daddys coming to the rescue on a blistering hot Sunday afternoon!	positive
Very nice place to grab a bit to eat.  Big portions friendly staff.  They should push the bacon more it was amazing.  Yes I know all bacon is amazing.  This was bacon squared.   Get the full body Mary and the biscuits and gravey or chicken fried steak.  They will not disappoint.	positive
Mood lighting. Hookup from the Pit Boss at the Asian High Roller place.... not that we gambled... but just flashed some pretty smiles and got VIP passes. \n\nMusic was good. Drinks were pricey, lounge areas were comfy.... dark enough so I could indulge in my lesbian tendencies and check out all the hot girls without being noticed... oh wait.... I think I was just checking out my best friend. Danced and watched the mood lighting change; yes I'm easily entertained. Had a nice selection of perfumes in the bathroom to freshen up!\n\nNot too many sleazy guys in there; always a plus in my book!! Great place to go with a group of friends; not a great place to go to hook up. =P	positive
Love Krispy Kreme  unfortunately Xavier has to be the worst customer service guy. No smile no customer service and when we asked a question he was impolite. No just fricken RUDE. Come in if Xavier is not here. Or not at. All. !!!!!!!!   \n\n\nXavier get a personality or go work in a mine where you don't have to engage people because you are not good at it at all .	negative
I've not hired Bruce, but have attended a few events which were catered by his company. Each one had a different theme - casual Hawaiian bbq, cocktail hour - and in each case, the food and service were just smashing. \n\nThe professionalism of his staff - at the grill, at carving stations, at the bar, at pretty much any point of contact - was just incredible. The host (various relatives) never had to worry about timing, keeping plates full or guests satisfied. I frequently heard other guests commenting about how wonderful everything was. Not one complaint, at least within my earshot - and I am the pessimistic type to listen for those. =) \n\nWhen it is time to cater our own event, I will be calling Bruce.	positive
God, it really pains me to have to update my review for this place. I go here a lot. I'm starting to think it's my own fault for putting up with crappy service.  I LOVE Dunkin Donuts, but the staff here SUCKS.  They screw up on my order 80% of the time and today was the last straw!!! GRRRR I am stewing as I write this. I was running late but seriously needed some caffeine and breakfast to get through the day. I went in the drive-through and ordered my usual, hot latte lite and plain toasted bagel with cream cheese. When I got up the window, she told me they were out of plain and suggested the everything bagel, which was fine. They finally get me my bagel and I rush off to work, Barely making it on time. I go to open my bag to eat my bagel, and it had no cream cheese on it. Ugh. Stupid idiots.	negative
I have been to PCCHH many times and I highly recommend this business. The owner, Nikki Remic-Bannon, has assembled a lovely team of well-trained and compassionate massage therapists and has created a lovely oasis in the middle of bustling Regent Square for your health, healing, and relaxation. Though this is certainly a business, Nikki and her staff make you feel welcome and cared for. I have been to studios where I felt like I was a dollar sign and could tell that the staff were not well-taken-care-of by the studio. That could not be farther from the truth here. I believe that Nikki is in the business for the right reasons and the people who are working for her seem happy and interested in what they are doing and concerned about the clients' health.\n\nThe two therapists I have seen most frequently are Chris Wright and Rebecca Aqra. Both are lovely people and great massage therapists. Chris can do some really intense deep tissue work (if you want it, of course) and has worked some miracles stretching out my head, neck, and shoulders. I know a lot of women prefer female therapists, but I encourage you to try Chris--he is a consummate professional and I was as comfortable on his table as I have been with any female therapist. Rebecca is a bundle of joyful energy who ferrets out problem spots and comes up with creative approaches to encourage stubborn knots to give in. \n\nTheir prices are not unfair, but unfortunately, it is the only thing that keeps me from coming on a weekly basis. If you have an injury or problem, or just need a hour of pampering, PCCHH can help you destress and get on the road to healing. I leave every time happy -- happy with the service I received and happy to do business with such lovely, caring people.	positive
The concept is good but the finished product is a mess.  \n\nLagasse's Stadium is a cross between Philippe Stark and a dive bar.  Go figure.\n\nSeveral televisions on several different sports stations conflicting with what the next person wants to watch.  Little crazy for those who go specifically to see a certain game at a $25.00 minimum.  Wouldn't be brave enough to order food but the beer is cold.	negative
If you are looking for a great wine shop, that you can also have dinner or share a bottle of wine and feel like you're not in Las Vegas anymore this is the spot.... Hidden in a Strip mall within Desert Shores this place has a deck that sits on the water...cool place for a change of pace...	positive
Yuk I asked for corned beef on toasted rye after a long wait i recieved a tough to chew pastrami on untoasted rye. I agreed to try it rather than wait. It was terrible. The waitress could see I only ate a couple of bites but still charged me full price. So I did what I never do I left not tip and left still hungry. Canters and Langers in Los Angeles still kick as.	negative
I stopped here for fuel and a car wash on my way from the gym to work the other day.  My car was in desperate need of a bath, and I didn't have time to visit my favorite Cobblestone car wash in Scottsdale.  \n\nBecause I did not want to continue to drive in shame, I figured a nice little rinse at the quick car wash would at least help a little.  My car is black and was so dirty it was starting to look like it had a nice gray primer coat on it.\n\nWhen the soapy cycle of the wash began, I noticed something flying above my car.  To my surprise, I looked up and notice several pigeons riding back and forth on the car wash \""arm\"".  To their credit, the pigeons looked quite happy going back and forth...back and forth.  I think one of them smiled at me. \n\n(A side note...where there are birds ready to poop, they will find me somehow.  I must have a poop magnet somewhere around me because it ALWAYS happens.)\n\nI am already stuck in neutral and it's still in the soap phase of my wash.  So I sit and wait.  I count how long it takes before one of the birds craps on my freshly rinsed car.  Of course, within moments of the dryer beginning and the green light flashes, I notice a nice little white pile on the hood of the car.  To make things even more enjoyable, the dryer smears the freshly deposited prize across my hood.  After all, who wants wet pigeon poop on their car?\n\nMoral of the story peeps...if you want pigeon poop and a car wash, this is THE place to be!  I was in a bit of a hurry so I didn't ask for my money back.  However, I did make a courtesy call later to kindly remind the owners of the gas station that they have some squeaky clean pigeons living in their car wash.  They didn't seem thrilled with my sarcasm.	negative
The Big Burrito is definitely filling and all the ingredients are super fresh. You get a wide variety of salsas to coat your food with, including a jalape\u00f1o and chipotle ranch. The al pastor tacos on Taco Tuesday are something few should ever pass up, especially when they're 2-for-1.\n\nEven at a pretty busy lunchtime the food came out quick and piping hot.  Definitely a place to visit most days, especially every Tuesday.	positive
I hate to be mean but this was the worst food that we have ever had in our entire life. It was so bad it was almost unbelievable. I think they are not busy enough so the food just sits there for hours and hours. I guess if you arrive at the right time when the food is fresh it would be okay but we were not that lucky. The owners seem very nice but the food is just awful, sorry :(	negative
There store employee/manager kristin is not at all friendly. She acts like she's doing a million things instead of providing customer service.	negative
Tonight, June 7th 2013, my family and I had diner at nous Trattoria di Mikes corner Crescent, and Ste-Catherine street, in Montreal, and we got really good service from \u00c9milie.\n\nI wish I could share the same excitement about Mikes restaurant and the two managers tonight, Steve and Charles. I find abusive that Mikes has incresed their beer pricing because of the Grand Prix week-end. There are two prices, the regular one for the beer and the even menu pricing.  When I asked to see the price on the menu, what was my surprise to find out that the Heineken price is not on the menu, an illigal practice in Quebec. \n\nTo insult me enven more, when I asked to talk to the manager he, Steve,  refused to take the time to come to see me, arguing he was too busy.\n\nI hav a bill with a beer at $6.09 for the first beer and $7.79 for the second beer.\n\nThe waitress , \u00c9milie, todl me that normaly both beers should have been charged at $7.79. the price for the week-end of the Grand Prix.\n\nThis practice is illegal.\n\nThank you Charles and Steve for not taking the time to come to see us.\n\nPS: By the way, it is not about the $1.60 extra that I was charged that made me upset, I still left 20% tip to \u00c9milie.	negative
I certainly don't come here for the pizzas - there are about 20 tastier pizzas in town off the top of my head. I come here for the incredible salads! They are a bit pricey, but you can get the full sized (2 meals in one), or knock a few bucks off for half - the perfect lunch.\n\nThey have such a fun creative array of options and toppings, like this one: \n\nMoroccan-spiced chicken breast with crisp Romaine lettuce, roasted butternut squash, Medjool dates, fresh avocado, toasted almonds, fresh beets, chopped egg, carrots, dried cranberries and red bell peppers. Tossed with our champagne vinaigrette. DELISH!\n\nI typically get the Cobb these days (it's low carb) and they have one of the best Cobbs in town. The avocado is always fresh and it's always loaded with meat and cheesey goodness. \n\nLook past the mediocre pizzas and try a salad - you won't be disappointed !	positive
I should know better.  I know.\n\nMcDonald's generally wouldn't get more than a three for average service, but you know sometimes you get that craving and for me, I hadn't had it in a loooong time.  Long and tiring day at work sometimes needs to be offered a little unhealthy nostalgic fast food.\n\nIt's even worse when McDonald's employees don't even care to be there.  Seriously, how hard is it to put together a burger?\n\nMy BigMac came without a piece of meat and without cheese.  When I pointed out their error, the employee giggled and shrugged her shoulders and handed me another one moments later.\n\nDumb.\n\nThen they had a huge banner that said \""Happy People Day\"" or some wierdness...signed by employees.  When I asked what it was about, they didn't even know.\n\nDuuumb.  You have a huge banner celebrating something that you're not even sure the reason for?	negative
Just awful, the service is horrendous and I come here at least twice a week, well not any more .. If they are busy or not they don't acknowledge you, and they screw up the simplest order \""Everytime\"" I'm patient I have been in the service industry... Sometimes was they just put your food in their toaster and forget about you... Never again ... I'm finding an Einstein bagel..  This place sucks!	negative
No! The rooms are decent BUT the hallways are disgusting. They need to tear everything out...wallpaper, carpet - they need to start over!  They're current renovating the casino which looks awesome. Be prepared to run into some scethcy ass people in the hallways. Oh yea...one night ALL the elevators stopped operating except for one elevator.  You had to truck up and down the stairs like a hurd of cattle.  Hopefully after they renovate the casino they will then concentrate on updating the room towers. Super old hotel but it actually feels more like a motel.  There was trash, food packages, FOOD, empty bottles, cigarette butts all over the floors in the mornings.  I feel super bad for the cleaning crews. Super Ratchetness!!!  OH how can I forget...one hallway you can actaully see blood splatter on the wall paper.  I about died!  RUN...do not stay here until they clean this ghetto ass place up!	negative
I wish that I had read the other reviews!!! My experience was exactly the same.  I purchased an item that they never delivered - in fact, they never had it in stock and now they have failed to refund me!!! AND THEY NEVER CALL YOU BACK OR EMAIL BACK!!! Now I have to work with my credit card company to file a notice of fraud, etc.... PLEASE beware when you shop at this website.  IT IS A SCAM!!!!	negative
great place - David is the man!	positive
I heard so many good things about this place and was very disappointed, first it was VERY expensive to eat for two people, better value and just as good BBQ next door. This was my first time here, and was over whelmed with the experience the workers didn't make it easy I felt rushed ordering and when I would ask questions, they would roll thier eyes....	negative
Never had an issue with the Filiberto's franchise. Always decent food, and always open! This one is on my way to work, sometimes at 4 in the morning! A good chili verde burritos sounds like a good way to start the day! In and out of there will fast, haven't ruined a order yet! Easy place to get in and our of there, located right off of Grand Ave.	positive
Huge place to shop for kitchen and restaurant uses...they carry lots cool things...check it out!!!	positive
Visually, the restaurant is pretty unassuming. Inside it has the classic decor of a local Italian dive with checkered tablecloths.\n\nFrom the start the waiter was talkative and friendly, offering us dishes not on the menu. When he mistakenly described the special as also coming with king prawns he promised that he could have it made that way especially for us. The chef also stopped by the table a couple of times to joke with us and ask how the meal was going.\n\nI was tempted by the pasta + wine special for \u00a37.90, but I couldn't resist the Seafood Stew based on Blythe's recommendation. The stew was overflowing with fresh mussels and fish for \u00a315. I'm not a big fan of salmon, so I was pleased that the stew had a rich variety of flavors, including a nicely smoked whitefish. The broth was tasty, but when I went to sop it up with the accompanying bread I was disappointed. The bread fell apart in my hands and had a wholegrain taste that didn't match the rest of the food.\n\nFor dessert I tried the Tiramisu and Banoffee pie. Both were fine, but nothing exciting.	positive
Love this place!  Super cute gem tucked away in a spot you would never guess.  A friend had to tell me about it or I never would have gone. Nice atmosphere with some fun decor.  There are lots of different seating postures so you can find what you like: sofa, lounge chairs, regular dining table, bar seating, and booth seating.  \n\nThe food is good as well. Didn't knock my socks off but definitely worth trying. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give 5 stars is bc the service is slow. We were sitting in the lounge area in the bar so perhaps they just need to get a server to cover that area rather than the bar tender.\n\nI will definitely be back!	positive
Love This place.	positive
I ate here for the first time last year. Any place where you can get RED KOOL AID DRANK is okay in my book. I had the chicken and waffles, why try anything else on the first visit? Would be nice if they offered a nap room for the post meal food coma. This will knock you on your ass.	positive
it says 'dive bar' on the sign, but plays deafening techno music to an empty room on a Saturday night. no tables where you can sit with friends. we wanted a dive bar and it's not, it's just a shitty small club. But even if I forgave it for not being what's on the sign, there's nowhere to dance if someone wanted to. So, not sure what it's trying to be, but it's not working. I felt so bad for the bartender, she was really nice. She turned the music down slightly and the guy working on the computer kept cranking it back up. So loud it was difficult to order a drink without hand signals from someone 1 ft away. Really strange.	negative
This review has been a long time coming. Casa Don Juan has been a must visit for me the past couple trips to Vegas thanks to a recommendation from a local friend. Why you might ask would I visit a Mexican restaurant with all the buffet choices available? Simple, as my Hispanic friends will say \""I'm an undercover Mexican!\"" I love Mexican food from birria, menudo, tacos de lengua con todo por favor, bring it on with extra tapatio! Honestly though my real reason for coming here is their camarones a la diabla! I've had my share of camarones a la diabla and I have to say they are one of the best. The spices and seasoning is perfect if you like food extra spicy the way I do. Plus you won't find any packaged mission tortillas here. They are freshly hand made and their guacamole is amazing! As another yelper stated they do take a souvenir photo while you're there which might seem tourisy but my friends and I did not mind. The waiters were friendly and attentive each time I was there so no complaints from me for customer service. In fact they brought me a cup of water even when I didn't ask for it and kept coming by to see if I needed more water thinking the camarones would be too spicy for me. Tsk, Tsk, little do they know this Asian chica loves the heat! My only gripe would probably be the fact that they do not serve jaimaca. I ask for it each time I'm there in hopes that they will finally say yes but not yet. For now their horchata and jugo de pina will do. In any event, if you're looking for a great Mexican food joint slightly off the hustle and bustle of the strip, give Casa Don Juan a try.	positive
WORST PLACE EVER, they sent me a bill the other day for $200 dollars from 8 months ago. They never looked into what my insurance would or would not cover and just screwed me over. Do not go here they are sales men and crooks and will give you an unnecessary hearing test and charge you for it, I'm 29 don't need a hearing test. AVOID at all Costs should really be 0 stars.	negative
Being delayed is never pleasant but a well appointed airport could help.  Things like dining options, free wifi, charging outlets and seating areas.  All things that this airport lacks.\n\nThe boarding areas are small and run into each other.  If everything is running smoothly, it's a tight fit but one small hiccup and BAAMM!  It's survival of the fittest.  Try balancing on your \""22 inch suitcase while hovering over a prized outlet while you feel the heat of staring eyes who want your tiny spot.  Geesh.  \n\nMust pack spare battery.	negative
Unfortunately just not very good. Not a terrible experience as the service was ok and busy place but food is marginal and price is on upper end for mex food. $11.95 for chips and guacamole... $8 for the house marg. $30 for fajitas for 2. That's all fine if it is good but sad to say most could make better mex food at home.	negative
we got this room through priceline's name your price thing, and we did get what we paid for. \n\nthe bath towels were shedding, room smelled old.\n\ni give it 1 star for the nice receptionist that gave us non-smoking room at the 63rd floor, and the pillows were comfortable.	negative
We bought our son a 2004 car here about a month ago. So far, we had to have the clutch replaced. Luckily it happened within 3 days of purchasing it so they fixed it for free. BUT, the car has been giving our son trouble when trying to start it. Dropped it at a local shop to see what is wrong. You name it - it needs replaced! Over $2000 to get it fixed. And some of these things are safety items and shouldn't be driven by anybody! I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place at all and I WILL NEVER EVER return! Total rip off kind of people! Not trustworthy! I can't imagine doing this to people every day. What kind of people are they? What a sad day.	negative
The yogurt takes just like ice cream.  The toppings are of good quality and include fresh fruit, snicker pieces, brownie chunks, nuts, etc.  A hefty filled cup runs us about $4.50 and is worth it.  You can get a card each time your yogurt weighs more than 8 oz and you get the 10th one free.	positive
Excellent extended stay hotel room with everything you need. Right off the strip so its nice and quiet but super easy to get to the strip. Complimentary breakfast was excellent with so much to choose from. The room was pretty spacious and every room has a balcony. We were lucky enough to get one overlooking the vegas skyline.	positive
I dont like to give bad ratings to businesses but this place is deserves a terrible rating! I have been here a 3 times, and everytime they have messed up on my order. Just Recently I stopped here for a quick bite to eat and I was throughly dissapointed in the service I recieved. The lady I dealt with was extremely rude. I would not recommend this place to anyone. This place delivers terrible customer service and below average mexican food. Don't waste your money on this place.	negative
I had lunch here earlier today and while the food is decent, something really turned me off.  I usually order water to go with my food and when I did, the server brought back 2 water bottles (for me & my wife).  I asked for just regular water but the server replied that his manager can only provide water bottle unless we also order drinks.   This nickel & dime-ing by the restaurant manager really put us in a bad mood.  The service was good (not the server fault) and the food came out fast enough.   \n\nWe order the Chips & Guac, Chicken Salad & Enfrijoladas (I think).  The food was decent. The total bill for 2 lunch with tips came out to about $31 and that includes the $2 charges for 2 bottle water.\n\nCongrats to the manager for forced selling bottle waters to the customers.\nWe won't be back to this place in the future.  I should've drove a bit further to Barrio Cafe.	negative
While the product was good, and very close to the real deal, the owner of this place, Jeff, allows his employees to hand out \""sno\"" balls to customers and other employees to literally throw them at anyone they want. I went here with my wife and 2 year old daughter, and had to stand outside waiting for my order, for fear of my child getting slammed in the face with a ball of ice. Absolutely horrible and unprofessional way to operate such a business.	negative
I like this place.\n\nI found out about Ryan's a couple of years ago and this is my go-to place for when I need certain pet products and want to save some money.  My girlfriend and I have great danes so when we were able to get a massive crate here for way less than other retailers wanted, we jumped on it.  If you have never been here it can be a little weird the first time.  Nothing is really labeled, though they finally put up category signs on the aisles so you at least know roughly where to go.  They have catalogs there that you can look at to find the prices of the products (nothing is labeled on the shelves) and you literally pull things out of bins.  \n\nThat being said, this is a great place to come for dog toys.  You can get a ton of toys on the cheap that are the same quality as other major retailers.  They do not sell food here but you can pick up treats if needed.  They also have a better selection of muzzles than Petsmart and Petco do.  If you haven't been here before, check out their website to get an idea of what they have before you come down.  It is a warehouse so be prepared that it is not air conditioned and can be a little muggy when you go in there.\n\nThe staff is typically friendly whenever I have been here.  I have not utilized the website as far as ordering but I do use it to compare products to other online stores.  If you have pets, I definitely recommend checking this place out.	positive
What a wonderful surprise! It has been a very long time since I had an auto place where the service was friendly, respectful and really beyond what I was used to or expecting. I had my alternator and breaks fixed, prices seemed reasonable and when I stopped in the next day to have them adjusted, they did so immediately and with a smile. I've been won over.	positive
Ordered the #1 right before close: mustard, chili, cheese, and onions.\nDog was out quick, service was friendly, but product was sub-par: small dog looked boiled and old, not at all visually appealing. \nTaste did not seem to include any mustard per the order board, but the chili was actually really good. Onions were weird, almost shredded to death instead of chopped. Bun fell apart halfway through eating.\nThis isn't the best food court I've come across, but there are better options here instead of this joint.	negative
Can't really say anything bad about this place, but it did not knock me off my feet. I went to use a Veebow discount at a restaurant next door, but saw that this was a lil more kid friendly so we stopped in. \nPros: Pizza was really good, not great, but really good. Salads was good as well, the food was not bad at all. They had a mac and chees for my son which I caught my wife enjoying as well.\nAll in all, we are going to help promote this business, because of friendly mgr and staff. They will keep seeing us there over and over.\n\nThis place is Good.	positive
Art is not trustworthy.  His mechanic broke something on my car (Not Tom, Tom is a very good guy and excellent mechanic.) and then got very angry with me when I actually (gasp) expected him to repair it!  The next time I came in he treated my wife and I very poorly. We started going through all our bills and realized he'd been overpricing us for years. After finding a better mechanic we were told we'd paid for things, fixed and replaced things we never should have.  We expected better after taking our cars there for eight years.  Art is a scheister taking advantage of poor older folks and families who don't know any better.  Do NOT trust him!	negative
Went in today not realizing that they had changed name and owners. NEW NAME IS HAPPY WOK. Ordered Won Ton Soup and all it was was broth, house fried rice and the house chow fun and NO flavor.  The new people were not as friendly and the son (?) acts like he isn't allowed out in public very often. Pretty awkward ordering experince. Off to find a new neighborhood Chinese spot	negative
4.5 stars?  Every person I know that has seen this show concurs that it works better than prescription sleeping pills.  I no longer have faith in Yelp as statements like \""Money Well spent\"" is a JOKE.  Caveat emptor with these pricey vegas tickets.  After watching Le Reve then this the first thing that popped in my mind was \""tourist trap\"".  Go to the RedBox, its much more entertaining.	negative
Very expensive and average. Every other restaurant in our casino was jammed so we went here. Food was ok. My shrimp dish was $25+ for only five shrimp! No pasta/rice or anything else with it. Ridiculous. To top it off, warm beer. Only upside was good service.	negative
I have never been let down by Back East Bagels. I feel completely comfortable just sitting and enjoying my food without being bustled out. Food is perfection and decently priced compared to other bagel/breakfast joints. \n\nI've heard some people complain that they do not offer wifi. I enjoy this but I know others want to be plugged in. \n\nAlso, coffee options are amazing. 6 different roasts and flavors and a variety of creamers. You know..if you're into that.	positive
Order the BBQ Pork, and as soon as I checked in at the location I got a free glass of champagne....allready off to good start	positive
Found this place on groupon. 25$ for 50$ worth of drinks, I mean who would say no to that! Plus I have this thing for tapas style foods so I was very excited to try this place out.\n\nCame here on a Friday night with my friend, it was extremely dead. First thing I smelt was smoke but hey, it's a bar what did I expect? Immediately greeted by Eric, our bartender for the night. He was very nice & attentive. He did mention he just started working so he was kind of clueless with the cocktail menus as well as the foods but I won't hold that against him!\n\nFor the foods--  this place is at the bottom of my list of tapas foods. We ordered..\nMango chicken -- nothing special about it looked like grilled chicken in mango salsa. \nStuffed dates -- The dates were so big! & was wrapped in a small size bacon that didn't match the portion size of the dates.\nCrab cake -- this was pretty delicious but the presentation of the dish wasn't appealing. When it came out it looked like a burger patty swimming in sauce. \nBuffalo wings-- nothing to say there it's wings lol \nCeviche -- it was pretty good. The chips looked like it came outta a bag that you buy at the super market.\nMeatball sliders -- meatballs were midget size compared to the bun. Tasted bland.\n\nCocktails & wine-- got the job done. They weren't terrible. \n\nOverall, I probably will not be returning. Me and friend did have fun there but we have fun anywhere really. Lol	negative
I have been to Peffermill a good few times to play football for the football supporters club. Although never really joining the team properly, I came along whenever they were a player short or needed some depth in the squad. I normally played in a five a side team that was not actually part of the uni and played at the Corn Exchange. \n\nI normally played on the astroturf pitches here and this means that you can never get a game to be abandoned throughout the year. The pitches were good quality and the changing room facilities were good too.\n\nThe worst thing about Peffermill is that it is a bit of a mission to get to, but this can't really be helped as there really isn't many other sports facilities more central than this.	positive
Outside of the fancy salons inside resort casinos in Las Vegas, this was the first and now the only nail salon I feel confident in going to.  I went to them based on other Yelp reviews.   I have basic mani/pedi needs and this salon is clean, well decorated and welcoming. I have gone multiple times now and continue to be very satisfied with my service.  Bruce in particular has always given me great service,  but all technicians and staff seem friendly, competent, qualified and grateful for my business.  I continue to simply Walk In versus making an appointment, but know the salon is busy and clearly popular....a good sign of happy customers showing patronage to a good business.	positive
The previous review is no longer the case as I just came here this weekend and ordered a cold cut combo with chips and drink combo and it was $8.00 and change. There was definitely no $14 sub. This place was full of Wendy's, Weinershnitzel, Noble Roman's pizza, Del Taco, DQ/Orange Julius, Starbucks, Panda Express, etc. This was the best bargain place to eat on the strip for both calorie and $ watching. Im so glad this place had subway..:)	positive
Gross!  Was so excited to try the Mexican hot dog and it was extremely disappointing.  I thought the bacon would add a lot of delicious flavor to the hot dog but it didn't.  The dog was tasteless as was the bacon.  Not sure how that happened.  the sweet bread bun was also very odd tasting with the hot dog.  Ive never had a mexican dog before so Im not sure if thats normal for the bun to be sweet but it really didn't work for me.  The whole thing left a horrible, awful taste in my mouth.	negative
We came here 1/1/09 right after viewing a traditional New Year's Day movie next door @ Rave Movie Theatre.  Since it was 10pm, it wasn't crowded at all.  I picked up a card right at  the entrance to the restaurant for a free appetizer with purchase of an entree (score!).  We ordered the fabulous mussels (usu $11.50) that came in a bacon cream sauce.  The entrees were delish but my dining partner didn't like the lasagne due to the fact that it did come in a cream sauce but I thought it was great because it wasn't thick & lasagne noodle-y.  My veal milanese classico was tasty & is lemony with (in a good way).  Our waiter, Allen, was fine, not weird as was mentioned in previous reviews but forgot to fill our water & ice tea.  Pretty decor, plentiful food, had a lot of leftovers for the next day so all in all would definitely return but I'll also ask my Italian colleague what she thinks	positive
$29.99/pp for an awesome 3-course meal? I'm all for it.\n\nMy sister and I got an e-mail from the Mirage advertising their prix fixe menus, so we made a reservation.\n\nThe ambiance is nice, but I think they could use more light.  \n\nThe service was great.  We had about three servers tending to us.  \n\nDrinks were awesome.\n\nFood was delish.  To start, I had the mushroom pot pie (SO GOOD), and Jenn had the crab cake, which she really enjoyed.\n\nFor the entree, I had the surf and turf.  They gave an ample portion of steak, but only one (yummy) jumbo garlic shrimp.  Jenn had the salmon, which she thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nFor dessert, I had the 12 layer chocolate cake, and Jenn had the butterscotch custard. Both were AMAZING (and I don't even like butterscotch).\n\nI'd recommend it, especially for the great price!	positive
I've always found large portions to be unappealing as my taste buds  hit the plateau of diminishing returns usually after 3 bites.  Stax solves that problem by offering 3oz sliders around $4-$5 and tons of choices for customizing them.  \n\nThe Moroccan Colorado lamb and the good ol' beef burger were nicely charred and full of flavor.  The sweet potato fries at $3.75 was not only delicious but a great deal given the generous serving.  The garlic aioli goes great with it.  \n\nI appreciated the no pressure service.  Even though between the two of us we only ordered a slider each and shared one order of fries, the server was cool with it.	positive
Perfect place for small children!!! Your leather lunged kid could scream and scream and scream, and would simply blend in with non-stop din of the other small kids and blaring televisions. Just like the  departure lounge going to Orlando at an airport!! The food is made for children, frozen boneless chicken fingers and fries, just like at home. Kids can and do wipe their hands on all surfaces available, so you don't even have to think about cleaning up after them. Everything is really, really sticky! Many families have found this place to be excellent, they fill the place. Bon Appetit!!	positive
Very nice facility that is well kept.  Can't wait to see a game with the roof open.  My only complaint would be that I wish they had more vegan friendly options. For instance, I attempted to get Subway but found the subs to be pre-made, which wouldn't work for me.	positive
Waited over 10 minutes for a toasted bagel. Finally had to ask for it. It was cold and nobody cared or apologized. The excuse was someone was in break.  Won't return for awhile	negative
The food is great as usual. And the service there never disappoints. Jeremy was awesome. \n\nFondue Feast. Lager and Cheddar Cheese fondue. The meats had the advertising Latin spin for the current Big Night Out. The dessert was dark chocolate with sea salt. All was A-OK.\n\nThe table next to us was inhabited by two of the most annoying groups of diners I've ever experienced. When we arrived, the meal was winding down for a mother, her 13-ish old daughter, and that daughter's friend. If they hadn't been so young, I would have sworn the girls were drunk off their respective asses. They kept screaming across the restaurant for the waiter, thinking they were going to hook him up with their cougar mom. I'm thinking that probably wasn't an option, as I'm pretty sure the waiter didn't play for that team. But hearing yells of  \""WE NEED MORE NAPKINS JEREMY\"" was enough to make want to throw hot bouillon over the wall onto their skank little heads.\n\nWe had about 15 minutes of quiet after they left, until this weird older couple was seated at the same table. The woman had a ghastly hat that looked like she had shopped at Savers for a hat to wear to the Churchill Downs. It was white with lots of lace and feathers and crap. And she left it on the entire meal. They went on an on with the waiter about how it was their 24th anniversary, we got to hear about restaurants that the husband was \""forbidden to go to\"" because of his flatulence, we were subjected to them listening to Jack Johnson on their phone, and had to hear their incessant nincompoopery while we finished our dessert.\n\nLove the Melting Pot, but maybe will go to one in a different area of town next time.	positive
Update: 28.08.10\nAlso hier musste ich erst einmal eine Nacht dr\u00fcber schlafen. So einen Service habe ich wirklich selten erlebt. Schnippische (meiner Ansicht nach schlichtweg freche) Antworten auf normale Fragen, Wartezeiten vor (!) der Bestellung von mehr als 15min, Wartezeiten auf die Cocktails die ins unertr\u00e4gliche gingen (mehr als 20min) und nachdem dann mehr als 30-40min eine Gruppe von 12 Personen auf leere Gl\u00e4ser geschaut hat den Laden durstig und komplett frustriert verlassen. \nAuch das Aufssuchen des Diensthabenen h\u00e4tte ich mir sparen k\u00f6nnen, denn dieser hatte nur ein Grinsen f\u00fcr meine Beschwerde (sachlich) \u00fcbrig. Ich empfand das Verhalten als pers\u00f6nlich verletzend und wir sind uns nicht willkommen und st\u00f6rend vorgekommen. Der Laden war im Innenraum max. 25% gef\u00fcllt. \nIch habe wirklich schon sch\u00f6ne Abende im Taquito erlebt, aber die letzten Erfahrungen zwingen mich diese \u00d6rtlichkeit auch mit Gesch\u00e4ftspartnern nicht mehr aufzusuchen (die hier sehr gerne hingehen). Mit mir als Gastgeber werde ich mir so ein Peinlichkeit wie gestern nicht mehr geben. \nNur um meine Darstellung zu konkretisieren: Wir sind mit 12 (!) Personen um 22:30 (!) Uhr in das Lokal. Da in der Bar (logischerweise) f\u00fcr 12 (!) Personen kein Platz mehr war sind wir unter den Sombrero (gro\u00dfer runder Tisch). Direkt nach der Begr\u00fc\u00dfung durch den Kellner wurden wir sehr bestimmt darauf hingewiesen, dass der Barbereich vorne und hier der Restaurantbereich w\u00e4re. Nur Getr\u00e4nke g\u00e4be es vorne (wir konnten uns dann aber durchsetzen). Noch mal zum mitdenken - 12 Personen um 22:30 Uhr! Nun mal noch zum Thema Grundrechenarten: Was ist mehr? 2 Cocktails \u00e1 EUR 7,50 oder ein Buritto (EUR 9,90) + ein Pils f\u00fcr EUR 2,60 ?	negative
Not good, the stuff looks great but very dry and lacking in the flavor department. The only reason we stopped there was because our favorite bakery was closed and we wanted sweets. \nThe place is dirty as well, I didn't expect that from a shop in Summerlin.	negative
I have been here a few times before the Diner, Drive-ins and Dives over the yeart. The only item I have had and really enjoyed was the meat ball sandwich. I was there recently and had the meatball sandwich which I had such fond memories of enjoying and it was okay. So, if I am in the area, I will give it another try.\n\nAnd one more thing, the Guiseppe's on Scottsdale Rd did have better meat ball sandwiches.	negative
If I could give them 0 stars, that would make me happy!  I will never purchase anything from them ever again.  They do not have the products they list in their catalog and when you order them they do not deliver!  No customer service!  Not helpful!  I normally don't write reviews but they have made me so mad, I thought everyone should know how they treat their customers.	negative
Naturally I'm picky about Filipino restaurants because I'll always compare it to my mom-in-law or grandma's cooking. I have been to Thelma's twice and I was a happy customer both times.\n\nOn my first visit, I was ordered Kare Kare (oxtail with veggies in a peanut sauce) and Thelma's special. I always order Kare Kare at every Filipino restaurant I go to because it's my favorite. I found it to be good but not the best I've had and with not enough meat (mind you, I said I was picky). Whenever I see a menu item labeled \""special\"" I expect to be blown away. I thought Thelma's Special to be okay... I found the onions and tomatoes to be a little overpowering. Overall, I was pleased with the food and especially the service.\n\nThe next time I stopped by, I had a hankering for Crispy Pata (fried pork leg). To my dismay, that wasn't on the menu. I settled for the Lechon Kawali instead and Dinuguan (pork blood stew). At first glance, it looked like the servings were small but my husband and I were quite full and had enough leftovers for the next day. What really made me love Thelma's was the quality of the food. The Lechon Kawali had just enough crisp in the skin and was so flavorful. I had never had Dinuguan with so little fat. Usually other Filipino restaurants mix a lot of fat with the meat to be most cost efficient. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very clean and well kept. The service is warm and friendly. The prices are reasonable.  I only wish they had more items on their menu. Otherwise, Thelma's is a restaurant that I would go to again and again!	positive
This place is an amazing hidden gem I am so happy to find good pho and cold noodles out here I will definitely keep coming back	positive
A very good steakhouse that makes sure you leave patting your belly in satisfaction.  The atmosphere here is very dim, and there really isn't a 'fascinating' view of the strip from here, but the service is impeccable.  I haven't experienced anything negative from any of the employees here.  The hostesses are attentive and cordial, the waiters prompt and knowledgeable, and the chefs....well they know what they're doing.\n\nLike most steak houses this place offers a huge porterhouse (24 oz) along with your standard Rib eyes, and NY Strips.  Everything is cooked to the proper doneness that you ask for.  Dishes are served A la carte, so you do have to pay extra for that baked potato or fries to go with your meat.\n\nSpeaking of sides, Their garlic steak fries are a staple for me here.  yes I'm a potato lover, and these fries are actually more like logs.  They're a huge potato that's been quartered, then fried w/ garlic, seasoned, then served.  I recommend you use a fork and knife to chow it down, but nobody says you can't use your fingers too....it is a fry after all.\n\nThe appetizers are great too, I highly recommend the crab & artichoke dip.  It is on the creamy side, but the flavor is great!  The mac & cheese is exceptionally tasty too, fresh cheese, bits of ham, very creamy.\n\nThey do have a cigars available for sale too, and a pretty good wine list.  This place hasn't failed to disappoint yet, except when it ran out of their bagel chips (served as a general appetizer with salsa).	positive
There seems to be a bit of hate for this restaurant based on previous reviews.  Luckily for me there weren't many negatives about my meal here.  So busy in my escapades around Las Vegas on my second day there I completely forgot about taking a break for lunch.  After perusing the menu the night before and observing dishes of what other patrons seemed to be enjoying I decided to drop in on the Dragon Noodle Co. inside the Monte Carlo Hotel & Casino for an early dinner.\n\nI was seated quickly by the restaurant's hostess.  Because it seemed not too busy I was given the option of sitting at a table, at the bar, in the lounge, at the sushi bar or in the main dining room.  I chose the latter, and I was quite surprised as the main dining room was nearly full.  This is another pricey Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas; although, it is not nearly as pricey as Jasmine at the Bellagio.\n\nThe heavy fabric napkins are all sleeved in paper holders printed with the restaurant's graphics (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=TaA0bI9GiB-96VrSODPxEw).  The restaurant uses a baby boy's face (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=DY_GqwfhoJGhbAY1ghUYDg) similar to the little peach boys of Chinese folklore (supposedly brings good fortune) as its main logo, and that image is amusingly plastered throughout the d\u00e9cor of the restaurant.  The wait staff will come around, unsleeve your napkin and place it on your lap for you.  I was quite new to this service so I stopped the young lady and gestured that I can do that myself.  Looking back it was pretty comical what I was actually thinking, but she took my beverage order and walked away.\n\nThree menus are presented, a dinner menu, a sushi menu and a huge, thick binder listing wines and spirits served.  It's a bit too early for a drink, and I never eat sushi at Chinese restaurants so away went those two menus.  They give you time to order here.  My peripheral vision noticed the waiter glancing my way every now and then, but he did not approach my table until I put down the menu.  I ordered the Salt & Pepper Calamari and the Roast Duck half.  Steamed rice is included with most entrees.\n\nMy bowl of rice and the calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=-HfxZmaC7AGYoN11jcimug) were brought out rather quickly.  Understandable as roast duck usually warrants additional preparation time.  The calamari was very good.  The calamari filets were scored, battered and deep fried.  There was just a hint of greasiness.  Salt, pepper and chopped jalapenos are used to season the battered calamari which were served on a bed of shredded lettuce with minced onion and garlic and more jalapeno slices.  The calamari had a nice kick to it.\n\nThe roast duck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=trW1SO7_8uHDTfpnsdTGpQ) was brought out a short time later.  It was served with a sweet and sour plum sauce which I found to be a bit generic in taste.  Where do these places find these ducks that are thick in meat and flavor and can't be found in San Francisco?  I loved the duck which was traditionally roasted Hong Kong style with the thin crispy skin similar to Peking ducks.  The flavor of the marinade was very good and there was tons of duck meat to enjoy.  \n\nIt took me a bit of time, but I managed to polish off everything.   Even so the waiter came by twice to check if everything was okay and whether I wanted more rice.  At the end of my meal he brought me a hot disinfectant towlette sealed in plastic to clean my hands and face.  I passed on dessert although the thought of having some freshly fried sesame balls did enter my mind.	positive
This guy has lousy customer service and an arrogant poor attitude! Stated he did not have \""men\"" working in our area of Lake Norman. Asked him if he subs-out work and he said no it's only him, so his \""men working\"" statement was misleading as it's \""one man working\"". Asked him if he works Mooresville area and he said yes but he won't come on this side of the lake even though we are 20 minutes closer to his office than Mooresville. Says on his website he'll help you fix your problems over the phone but thats a false claim from this experience. AVOID AVOID AVOID Call Tarheel Appliance Service instead 980-225-7802 as they were super nice and helpful....	negative
We just spent the week at THE Hotel and were looking forward to spending time at the pool, but only spent a few hours there during our entire stay because it was over crowded and over priced even for the Strip! After fighting for two chairs in the 115 degree heat and buying an inner-tube for $23 we were then robbed by the \""Bikini Bar\"" for another $24 for a corona and a small pina colada! The lazy river was totally over crowded with screaming, splashing kids! \n\nWe will definitely be back to THE Hotel but will leave the pool for the kids!!!	negative
Finally checked this place out . Cindy was amazing. I will definitely be back for a pedi next week. Also can't wait to bring my 4yr old in to try out the kids pedi chair!!!!	positive
Dense. Weird. Fantastic. I'm not one who knows much about art, let alone the specific details about someone like Andy Warhol. That's exactly why I went. To learn and to experience. This is a really nicely laid out museum and really does a great job paying tribute to a modern great. There is a ton of pieces on display and you could spent days here. If you're in Pittsburgh, I wouldn't hesitate to visit, love him, hate him, or know nothing about him, that's why you should go.	positive
Hi my name is Leo and I'm here cuz my friend couldn't make it.\n  I visit this store about once a week, I could probably be the duke by now but I don't \""check in\"" in liquor stores, being the duke of a liquor store may not look so good on a background check. Having said that, I kind of like this store because I never had a problem finding what I'm looking for,( alcohol) except this time, I was looking for that creme de violette to make that  aviation cocktail I learned at P.J.Clarkes on saloon 101 elite event, but they had no idea what I was talking about. (They gave me that look like they were talking to a drunk.) Oh well.. Since I'm here I might as well pick up some vodka for my friends.\n   This store is huge! They carry a large selection of almost everything. You can find almost any kind of beer you're looking for. The selection of wines is very extensive making it easy to find that special wine for that special event at any budget. The collection of tequilas is also very impressive! But best of all! prices are very reasonable and they also have sales daily. When I was there they had some gin, vodka and wine tasting going on and  I tried them all,.... twice! which Made my friends  ( me, myself, and I ) very happy.\n Clientele at this store is like the clientele at any other liquor store, you'll run into the good the bad and the ugly, this is one of the few places you'll find a cop a priest a hooker and a MADD in the same line. Make sure you look at the wall of pictures of people that went for the ultimate discount, (five fingers) you might know someone there and that's where the party is at!  I'll be back for refills.  Salud Mr. Lee!	positive
FOR THOSE THAT LIKE SALMON FLAVORED CHEWING GUM...\nI've had Krab with a K before but not Phish with a Ph (as in PHOOEY!) A group of friends and I went to The Ka on a Wednesday night and they were closed for construction so we Yelped for an All-You-Can-Eat Sushi (AYCES) place near by. Here is a prime example as to why you cant rely on a Four Star rating when there are only seven ratings. Of the ratings, three were from locals, four from visitors. We Vegas locals take the AYCES trend for granted, but most major cities don't have a lot of AYCES places. When a FOUR STAR review starts like this:\n\n\""7 words...  All-you-can-eat-sushi-to-order! Wow.  Not the best sushi I have ever eaten but when it's all you can eat for $21.95, what can you really complain about?\""\n\ncan you really rely on a review like that? NOT ME! I can excuse the visitors that are enchanted by their first AYCES experience (And who can't? It's like the time you popped your cousin's cherry at church camp!), but I've got seven words for that reviewer: \""Glutton! It's all about the raw fish!\"" \n\nBut it's the locals and those that call this \""the best in Vegas\"" and \""high quality\"" that leave me speechless. For the woman who has been going to this joint for three years (THREE YEARS!!!) here's a bit of advice: Get a date, have him take you out to another respectable AYCES place like The Ka, Sushi Mon, or I Love Sushi, and DISCOVER THERE IS A WHOLE NEW WORLD OUT THERE. Good God, it's like a Mormon who has his first Silver Bullet and thinks he's found the Nectar of the Gods. WALK THE TWO MILES TO THE KA and discover fishy yumminess. You could use the walk after eating so damn much!\n\nLook, there are literally over 100 AYCES joints in Las Vegas, and they range between $21.95 and $27.95. There are some decent places in the $21.95 range, but hell, it's SUSHI, pay the extra few dollars and go to a GREAT PLACE LIKE THE KA!\n\nThe ambiance was the same minimum standard in the valley. It's a good thing I didn't come to eat the decor, because there wasn't any to look at, let alone eat. The sushi bar had 7 stools and they could seat another 30, maybe. At least the place was clean.\n\nBut let's get down to the REAL reason we are here: TO CONSUME A TON OF RAW FISH. Why else are you going to get so excited to eat at an endless trough for $21.95? If you want to just stuff your gullet, go to one of the Station Casinos' Feast Buffet for 2/3 the price and roll yourself home. WE ARE HERE FOR THE FISH, BABY!\n\nWell, at least, that is why I WENT there, but I won't be going back there for the fish. My #1 marker for a good sushi joint is the Salmon, and my girlfriend (former LA food critic) goes by the Yellowtail. While the Yellowtail was passable (but still not \""good\""), the SALMON SUCKED. Wrigley's makes a much tastier chewing gum and it ain't $21.95, either. You know how good salmon looks, that beautiful orange color with as little of the white marbling as possible? Well, apparently they don't at Sushi Bay. Not only was it heavily marbled which made it less than favorable texture, but it had a lot of that brown stuff which is too close to the skin and is just out-right chewy. BLECH. Sadly, it didn't even have that good salmon taste. It was very bland and watery. And they are STRICT and annoying as hell constantly telling you (maybe even threatening you) that they'll charge you for anything you don't eat, so I got stuck eating 10 pieces of bad salmon. Grrrr. \n\nThe menu has a good variety of rolls, but that's typical for almost every sushi place in Vegas these days. The rice was mushy and they use WAY TOO MUCH RICE in the rolls. Only a few were passable. I never get Lobster Rolls in anything but the very expensive joints because THINK ABOUT IT: do you think they can afford to give you GOOD lobster roll for anything less than $20 a roll? Hell no, most places are using the lowest quality lobster just so they can say they have one. And no surprise here at Sushi Bay, it sucked. And of course they are going to suck, as the quality of the fish is rotten. Even the seaweed in the miso soup was chewy, not the light, delicate stuff found in good sushi joints.\n\nLook, you don't have to take my word for it. There are six other people who recommend this place. If you've read my review and the others and you still want to check it out, I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE you to do so. And then come back here and mea culpa and we can go to The Ka together and have some REALLY GOOD SUSHI THERE.\n\nNow, bring me a bucket!	negative
Was a Freakin Frog regular, but got tired of the stuffy attitudes.  I really missed the beer list, though, and Yardhouse doesn't come close. Most Yardhouse beer servers couldn't tell the difference from a Westvleteren and a Bud Light Wheat.  But Money Plays is unpretentious, boasts a Frog-like beer list because they poached one of the best beergeeks (a compliment) ever to pour for Mr. C., the prices are just right and the staff is helpful and knowledgeable.  If you live on the West side of Vegas like me, it's easier to get to.  The interior is nothing to boast about but after a couple of belgians it won't make a bit of difference.  Cheers!	positive
False advertising on Travelocity. You will not get the newly remodeled rooms they show you on Travelocity. The pool chairs are disgusting. The two Yvonne's at the front desk are not very friendly at all. The food at the restaurant was nothing to write home about. No refrigerator and the bed hurt my back. Not sure how this place is still in business. I will NEVER stay here again. Not worth the drive, just stay in downtown Scottsdale or Talking Stick. \n\nThe two stars is for the hotel staff (not the front desk people) and the beautiful backdrop of the surrounding mountains.	negative
Very cool family trip not a lot of activities and the costumed employees acted  like we were actually bothering them. Never the less it was fun and my daughter liked it	positive
It's time for an impromptu dinner session with a close friend.  We just got through watching a friend's internet show cast at The Beat and wanted to grab a bite to eat.  I've been to Fremont Mediterranean Caf\u00e9 before and wanted to bring her here.  She was up for a clean meal so this was a perfect match!\n\nWhen you get into the caf\u00e9, it's exactly that.  A few tables, a long counter to order and a small seating area outside.  It's a nice, quaint size.  The staff is super friendly.  Our cashier initiated some conversation with us and made us feel welcome.  \n\nFor dinner, I got the Turkey Avocado wrap for $8.95.  Pretty affordable, in fact all wraps are $8.95.  My wrap included a spinach tortilla, turkey breast, avocado, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, banana peppers and a pesto spread.  I liked this combination a lot.  The mix of mild red onions and the tanginess of the banana peppers really makes the Mediterranean flavor.  They packed the wrap with turkey so it ended up being super filling.  Avocado and pesto brought the dish together.  It's a huge wrap and you will love it!\n\nThis place is exactly what they advertise:  Fresh, Natural and Healthy.  Ironically, it's located right next to the Heart Attack Grill.  Choose to be healthy and you will certainly love this place!  Come check them out.	positive
Service is consistently underwhelming.   The attractive AND competent servers probably work on the strip.  Food is usually good for bar fare.  Probably won't be back since there are so many other options in the area.	negative
blech.  this isn't pizza.  the steak hoagie tasted decent, but that's not steak either... then again this wouldn't be worst decision you could make at 1AM	negative
Went to dinner on a Saturday night. The food was AH-mazing. So delish. They had a few performers during our meal. A gentleman who sang like some dude in the rat pack. And a soulful woman who sang the blues. Very cool!	positive
Tim Hortons in Montreal is kind of like the Dunkin Donuts in Boston, they are quite literally at every corner of the street. They sell quite an variety of pastries, chocolate bread, muffins, and donuts. The sizes here are usually half of what you would find in a DD, quite fresh and perfect for a snack. Both cold and hot drinks are available from latte to hot chocolate, from smoothies to ice coffee. Although equally as popular as DD in the US, it has less of a fast food type of feel to it, quite cozy and warm.	positive
Really? I had to make reservations for this place? Because on a Saturday night over Labor Day, this Envy The Steakhouse was completely dead. There was one other table in there. When we left, there were maybe 5. We had a restaurant.com coupon, so thank goodness we didn't pay full price for this place, because I would've rather taken my money to Fleming's.\n\nOur waiter was this super mellow guy, and was really nice. He did pay attention to details because he knew we didn't want ice in our water and made sure he didn't accidentally pour it in when it came to refills. It's the little things.\n\nWell, the big thing was the price. We ordered the 10 oz. filet mignon to share between us for $45 and paid a $5 split plate charge. $45?? Are you kidding me?? We started with the gnocchi which had wild mushrooms and parmesan fondue, which was pretty good. We also ordered the steamed broccolini. The steak was definitely not worth the money, because the outside was cooked to a slight crisp (not a problem for me because I like a bit of char), but the inside ranged from well-cooked on the sides, to cold red center, which is not good. A well-cooked filet, ordered medium rare, is a cool pink throughout. What I also didn't like was that they cut the steak in half for us and brought it out on two plates, just because we split it. Well, it probably didn't get to cook enough since you cut the sucker open, and it got colder by the time you brought it to the table. \n\nWhat was good was that your entree comes with a small crock of mashed potatoes and roasted season vegetables, which was yummy. That's a nice addition, considering most steak places just give you a steak, a la carte. \n\nThey had forgotten the steamed broccolini and didn't bring it out until we asked for it. We had a wine from their seven for seven list, which was pretty good for $7. The ambience was very hotel/steakhouse-like. I still felt like I was in a hotel, and I thought the decor was trying a bit hard to be on a more upscale than what it really was. At least I didn't have to dress up to eat here. They didn't balk at my track suit jacket I had with me because I was too lazy to pack anything dressy for the trip. \n\nSo glad we didn't pay full price for it. It was barely worth it even with the coupon. I do not have steak ENVY.	negative
This might sound brash - but for a city built on an excess to the senses, you have to execute things well.\n\nAnd the Cosmopolitan to me, is the name of my favorite drink, and is one of the newest hotels on the Strip that I kept hearing about. So I wanted to see it for myself.\n\nThe styling in the hotel fits me well. I was awed and noted a lot of the little details they infused into the place. It was like Tom Ford had a party with David Bowie and then did drugs with maybe Christian Dior or Diane von Furstenberg. Just very cool, modern, with touches of glamour everywhere.\n\nHowever, a few detrimental notes:\n\nThe Chandelier, was hyped up to me but once I was inside it - it lost its lustre. Yes, you are a sitting in a place strewn with crystals, but I expected a little more. It also didn't do them well, that once sat - it took about 10-15 minutes to be noticed. And this is while everyone is waiting in line at Marquee on a Saturday night. So needless to say, first impression of service... BLEW.\n\nThe signature Cosmopolitan sucked. And for it being the name, I expected something out of it. It's like Carrie Bradshaw took a big wee-wee in my glass. \n\nWhile styled well, the hotel might have been planned out more than what it should have been. Everything was packed in so tight and it made for a bit of claustrophobia. You couldn't see where you were going, when you walked in and about. Best design element that struck a chord were the video walls in the lobby. Those fascinated me the most.\n\nCrowd was okay - it tasted like LA walking through here. There was so many LBDs (or little black dresses to you) that it looked like Herve Leger took a big shit on the place.\n\nBottom line lies in the execution. For paying good money, you still need to be seamlessly good, and the Cosmopolitan failed at that point just on the surface. It still holds my curiosity at this point, but it wouldn't be my first choice to come back to when staying in Vegas - I don't think.	negative
A \""90 minute\"" timeshare presentation took upwards of six hours. Totally ruined our vacation. Then at the end they tried to give us different gifts than we were promised.	negative
the beerfest gets crowder and stupider the closer it gets to the weekend.\n\ni volunteer some of my time working this year at the yelp booth spreading the words to non believers about the virtue of using the website and the app itself. the shit is free to use, what's not to love? at the same time, i got to walk around and sample some beers (coupons are $1 each and beers are between 2 to 6 with the most expensive being around 12 i believe) that sounded interesting before the weekend crowd which is awesome because you get more choices.\n\nmy first stop was at dieu du ciel which you know have really great tasting beer with not much aftertaste if you're a non beer drinker, like i am. i tried the solstice d'\u00e9t\u00e9 which has a sour note because of the raspberry. it is pretty good if you enjoy fruit base alcohol and are looking for something not too off putting. there's the brise-glace which is an apple cider beer. a cider beer? i know! there's no words to describe it besides, fucking good!\n\nmy second stop was at trou du diable. a beerfest without stopping by them is plain stupid! any beer they offer is pretty good. i couldn't remember the name of it but it's definitely not the succubus as that one sold out pretty quick.\n\nthird stop at beau's all natural brew. definitely the highlight of the fest for me. i tried the bog water which is ok but the hogan's goat and especially the russian imp (a black beer) will make a beer lover out of you!\n\nfor my fourth stop, i made my way across the hall to the lovely peluso stand to sample the smoked barley wine from pit caribou that another yelper working the booth suggest me to try. if you are looking for something totally different to try, this one it is. there's that light charcoal taste you get at first and it smooths out once swallow. you'll enjoy it if you love bbq.\n\nmy fifth stop was at the brazilian stand where i tried some banana beer. it smelled like banana, doesn't taste like banana but there's a light sweetness to it that makes it enjoyable provide that you enjoy sweet beer.\n\nsixth and final stop was at the international stand to try some nogne brand beer. it's a norwegian beer brand and by that time, i was pretty out of it so i can't really remember anything besides drinking it all.\n\nUPDATE: on my last day working the yelp booth, me and some yelper sample some more stands. At first, we were looking for a second round of la brise-glace from dieu but they were sold out. kinda a bit bum, I walked over to our neighbour booth friend and asked if they knew about any other cider vendor which led us to la branche. The ice cider wasn't bad while the maple cider and the bubbly cider were hits amongst us. Before that, I walked over to the maple stand for some maple cider tasting. While I don't remember the name, there's one cider that had a maple butter like taste. It was rich, creamy and so ever smooth, it was like drinking liquid gold. Too bad you had to shell out money for a bottle instead of getting a 4 ouncer like most booths. And I went back to peluso for a second go at that smoked barley. I don't know if it was because of the maple cider I taste just before but I detected some lychee note amongst other things in the beer which I didn't previously. interesting\n\nfor food, i stopped by the globe trotteur stand to get some seal merguez and skippy burger (kangaroo). it is a bit pricey for what you're getting (the skippy is a slider) even though it's pretty tasty. if i could keep on affording it, i'd keep eating skippy ;)\n\nbad monkey popcorn is some freaking good popcorn! the ketchup one is not bad, a bit sweet like you'd expect from ketchup powder stuff. the jalapeno is quite spicy! me and some yelper choked on some kernels. the nachos and all dressed ones were the best of the bunch. considering it's 2 for $5, you can't go wrong with both. i did hear that they have some caramel and jalapeno popcorn which sounded interesting.\n\nUPDATE: while I was enjoying some wine I sneak in from home (had to drink something else too), I felt it was missing some cheese so I head over to fromage d'ici and got a trio of Roy Leo (I think) cheese plate. It was some good cheese but the mouthwatering one was the cheese fondue platter of the 3 cheeses that I got too. Made with some white wine, we just couldn't help ourselves. Words don't do justice of how good it was. You have to put it in your mouth to really grasp the collective mouthgasm we had!\n\nwe did get some freebies from our neighbour beer booth but that is between booth neighbours.\n\nmost staff working are pretty nice and friendly. we even got them to join in our photo madness!\n\nif you love beer or want to try something better than the non drinkable commercial stuff you get at grocery stores, you ought to attend the fest and sample. the best times are wednesday and early thursday where you can stroll around and hear yourself talk. i didn't really like beer but after trying multiple ones, i can definitely say it's almost love at first beer	positive
Get here early for lunch...they get filled up. Sandwiches are great as is the soup.  I have moved from Charlotte, but I have never found an egg salad that competes.	positive
Back in August, in the peak of summer heat, a local showed me this place because he knows Im a vegetarian (a hard thing to be in Vegas!). I was very suspicious of his recommendation because most Thai places are not strictly vegetarian and can get pretty slippery when it comes to the fish oil. I was very pleasantly surprised by the integrity of their veggie options... they didnt smell fishy in the least.\n\nIn fact, their intentions were so clean that when I asked for \""hot\"" on the \""low/medium/hot\"" scale, the waitress refused! I said, \""come on, i want it hot, baby!\"" said: \""you cant handle \""the hot\"", im sorry darling\""... and the more she denied me her spicy goodness, the more I wanted it. finally she gave it up when I said, \""lacking any chest hair, i've disgraced my indian ancestors, now gimme those chilies to get my testosterone flowin' sweetheart!\"" she winked at me, and sent in the order.\n\nand lemme tell ya, the \""hot\"" was frickin' amazing... made us sweat bullets, and nothing beats the Vegas summer than a blazing hot bowl of green curry. unfortunately my friend (the local), completely forgetting how tortuously hot the curry was,  gave the left overs to a homeless guy sitting on the street under the 110 degree heat. poor dude didnt even have a bottle of water handy either!	positive
Ohh don't get me started on Cox.  First when you have ANY problem at all, getting a live human being on the phone takes up to 15 minutes as you weave your way through \""press one for... ok now press ..\"".  Then the most they can do if your cable isn't working is tell you to unplug the box  and plug it back in.  Technical genius!  Then they schedule you a cocky, know-it-all but still somehow totally unhelpful technician to come out like four or eight days later.  We've been through seven boxes since we moved  six months ago because the dvr freezes and doesn't record properly ... on a regular basis.  I just think for the RIDICULOUS amount they charge me, the fact that we MUST have cable just to get any kind of regular programming, and the amount of problems their service has on a regular basis ... it should be a HELL OF A LOT EASIER TO GET ISSUES RESOLVED OR EVEN JUST TO TALK TO A LIVE PERSON.	negative
My experience was alright. The food was average. I was expecting amazing from all the buss about this place. Our waiter was sub-par and not very attentive to us, or nice for that matter and there was this really loud and obnoxious blonde waitress's that kept yelling and singing very badly to the music. She didn't even know the words. Very annoying. Just cause it wasn't that busy doesn't mean there aren't customers here. It was so annoying to eat with this waitress walking around being so irritating.	negative
I attended the mothers day brunch here as part of Vegas Uncorked 09'. It was hands down one of the best meals I have ever had. I find myself daydreaming about it constantly. All of the food was served family style and was absolutely amazing. I really enjoyed every single dish that was served but the dishes that stood out the most to me were the pork belly and wagyu skirt steak. DROOL!The service was top notch. The waiters kept the unlimited champagne and mimosas flowing.  And they were happy to get us additional servings of the dishes if we wanted more. My table went through a lot of the pork belly. It was awesome to see Tom Colicchio and get an autographed cookbook that included recipes of some of the items we ate that day. I definitely recommend this place and can not wait to go back!	positive
My husband, 3 year old daughter and I ate at Renegade last nite with another couple.  We hade been meaning to go for months and I am glad we finally made it.  I am always a little aprehensive to go to a new place with my daughter since I never know if the atmosphere would be good for kids or not.  Is this a place you can let your kids run around in? No However, they have a greta kids menu and give the kids a cactus coloring sheet and crayons.  The atmosphere has a good vibe and a nice buzz.  (I don't frequent quiet places with my 3 year old so this was great).  \n\nThe restaurant is really beautiful. I was surprised how busy it was at 6:30 (full, as was the bar)\n\nWe had a variety of dishes starting with the green chili pork stew and tortillas as an appetizer. This was amazing!  I could seriously go back for dinner again and have this as my meal. Everyone loved it.\n\nOther dishes we had:\n*  Filet Mignon - This had great flavor and was a good cut of meat. The mashed potatoes that came with it were just OK (I am picky when it comes to these)\n* Burger - HUGE. way too big to eat without a knife and fork.  It was REALLY good. I am not a big sauce person and I even liked the sauce that came on it (maybe a chipotle mayo or something like that) Skinny fries were delish.\n* Green chili mac and cheese - this was soooooo yummy! You can actually order a small side. We did just to taste it and I am glad we did. Really yummy and the texture was great with the combo of soft noodles and toasty bread crumbs.\n* Caesar salad - fresh, crips greens - a little (just enough) garlic. This was topped with jalapeno croutons and they were great.\n* Pot Roast - I didn't try it but my friend loved it\n* Roasted Chicken - Again, didn't try this but it got rave reviews.  I saw several people eating this while we were there as well.\n* Bread pudding - this was really great - and it has some sort of rare mushroom in it that gives it the caramel/maple flavor. yum!\n* My daughter had the vanilla ice cream (I wasn't sure if it was ice cream or gelato but it was home made and delish!)\n\nWe will definitely be back to Renegade.	positive
After attending a nearby Yelp event, a few yelpers decided it was time for a burger. I heard Bobby Flay, burgers and beer....I was sold! \n\nI was instantly impressed with the layout of this joint. The tables were in a semi \""S\"" shaped style, which made for interesting dining. The tables were large and held about 10 people. The entire setup of the restaurant was fun and creative. No one walked away from our table a stranger. \n\nThe line was long but went quickly. We waited less than 5 minutes from the time we walked in until the time we placed our order. I approached the cashier knowing exactly what I wanted. I was quick to order and to pay. \n\nThe Bill: $22.16.....ehhh\n\nThe Brunch Burger - certified Angus beef, fried egg, smoked bacon and American cheese. I like my meat a little pink to keep the flavor so I ordered medium. The burger was nicely cooked but on your typical sesame seed bun. The egg and bacon was amazing, really who could argue with a fried egg and smoked bacon?? The burger was good but not the best burger I've ever had.  Not sure it was worth the $9.50, but I knew walking in I was paying for the name behind the burger. \n\nThe Half and Half - you can order one side for $4 each or combine 2 sides for $5. You have the option to get french fries, sweet potato fries or beer battered onion rings. I decided to go for the the regular fries, with the all amazing BBP Fry Sauce and the Beer Battered Onion Rings. The fries were tasty, crisp and all around the perfect fries. No complaints. I was a little disappointed to only see 2 onion rings come with the half and half. I mean really, those rings were perfect and you're going to tease me with only 2? \n\nBeer - Miller Lite. Yes, BBP has its own decent selection of beers, drinks, wines spiked milkshakes and margaritas, I stuck to my roots and went with a Miller Lite. After all, they didn't have PBR. \n\nOverall, the food was good but nothing about it stood out to make my mouth water as I write my review. The staff checked on us regularly and even made sure we all had beers when we were getting low. Just because of the experience, friendliness of the staff and my urge to try more burgers on the menu, I will probably return.	positive
Extremely enjoyable place with a warm atmosphere, fantastic Bloody Mary, great beer and whiskey selections	positive
When it comes to getting a pet a fish is usually the standard place to start.  They offer admittedly only a mild amount of entertainment, but it does offer a cheap test of your commitment to caring for a very undemanding living being.  You may even grow to love fish and their simple nature that never tires of going up and down the same old stretch of water.\n\nHaving decided to get a fish you simply must come here as it can't be matched by anything you get elsewhere.  The range is simply unbelievable and despite this the prices are very good.  This is the one stop fish shop.	positive
Firefly...you finally made it to Hendertucky! It's always busy, which is a sign of great food and they never split large party checks which is a sign of laziness BUT...the place never leaves me disappointed and always leaves me craving more.	positive

I love Trader Joes!! Living downtown has turned me into a 2+ times a week shopper of TJs. I love how cheap and unique everything is. The staff is friendly, like really friendly, like they cant wait to get out of bed and sell groceries . TJ has all of the staples of my life for a great price; hummus, produce, meat, cheese, and WINE. \n\nOnly have 2 small complaints. One is parking (at the Met location). I have solved this by parking across king street in the big empty lot and taking the crosswalk over to the Met. Second, sometimes it takes a LONG time to check out. I think this has something to do with the uber friendliness of the staff. And please, for Christ Sake, start bagging your things as they are checking you out.	positive
I thought about giving Paisan's just one star but decided the amazing view was worth another. I'll start by saying that there probably isn't another restaurant in Madison with such a prime, waterfront location.\n\nAnd that's a huge shame because the food here is no good. It's supposedly Italian, but less authentic (and less tasty) than Olive Garden. The dishes are so plain - why should I go out to eat to order spaghetti in tomato sauce? Sure, at a really good Italian place simple works well, but here the food really does not taste professional at all. Pizza is the easiest thing in the world to make taste amazing yet at Paison's it is so mediocre. It probably says something about the kitchen's culinary expertise that the menu boasts a ham sandwich with banana peppers as the restaurant's most famous item.\n\nI would only say go here if you must, must eat on the water downtown. Even then, I would probably rather get food at the terrace or something.	negative
I had high hopes, but i was not impressed. this is the first show i started falling asleep with. It came with my hotel when we stayed there. It had high flying acrobatics with water. the performers come from the roof hooked to cable. I didn't really hate it i just wasn't impressed. Glad i didnt have to pay for it.	negative
My wife and I want to Geno's because our usual (and favorite place) Venezia's was packed.  To be honest, we should have waited at Venezia's.\n\nWe each had a slice and split the Greek Salad.  The pizza was horrible, reminded me school lunch pizza.  The dough at Geno's tasted frozen and looked unappetizing when I lifted up to look at the bottom.  \n\nWe will not be back and wouldn't recommend this place to others.	negative
Average burger, average taste, above average prices. Anyone who thinks this is good food has no credibility when it comes to food. If you want cheap cheese, bland meat, and a lot of grease and want to pay too much this is the place. I go to Columbus OH for work, Graffiti burger is the place over there. They have a big sign over the Five Guys in Columbus. I passed by the Five Guys, almost empty, go to Graffiti, PACKED. There is a reason for that, they serve the best burgers around. I so wish AZ had a place like that. Until that happens, I am in search for the best burger in AZ.	negative
My girlfriend and I went there this past Sunday for the second time.  We went previously for my birthday and had a great experience.  The food is always great and very hot when it comes out.  I love steak so it is always right up my alley.  This past Sunday's experience fell short.  Our waitress, although nice, was not attentive and did not listen to what we had to say.  We ordered an appetizer and needed it prepared in a certain way, but it did not come out as we ordered.  We saw our waitress all of three times the entire night.  My girlfriend ordered a bottle of wine which was on the \""last call\"" list.  We waited 20 minutes before she came to tell us that the bottle was not available.  The busboy that was associated with our waitress might as well have been our server.  He was great.  He made sure everything was to our liking and even refreshed my girlfriends wine glass.  \n\nWhen the food did arrive, we were satisfied with it.  The two times that we have been, the food is always exceptional.  But, you can't help but notice the lack of service.  I have to say it did affect our time there on Sunday, but won't hold us back from coming back.  We can only hope that the service will be better the next time.	negative
xl pick up pizza good deal. ghetto area\n wouldn't walk there at nite. Chick taking orders kinda rude. Expensive for delivery but pick up u get what u pay for.	positive
I have thought about writing this review for a while and have finally decided to get out. I have been with this practice for over three years now and the service has consistently declined. Within the past year the time it takes to even make appointments has increased to 15min of waiting on hold just to then have them tell you that they don't have any appointment times open that will suit your schedule for at least two weeks. I have not seen the same physician each time I have visited in the past year and only one time have I received courteous service. If you want to be able to see the doctor in a timely manner and have the staff at least seem like they care about you consistently, then South Point Family Practice is not the place for you.	negative
We live on Montreal and this is one of our favorite breakfast spots. We always recommend our friends and guests go here when in town.\nSide of French toast, an ABSOLUTE must!!!	positive

Rockin' Taco is located on the second floor.  The bar overlooks the strip.  Bf and I sat at the bar and grabbed food from the adjacent station.  I ordered a salad with beef and guac.  The staff was stingy with the ingredients.  The quesadilla was okay.  Meat was $2 extra and there was also a $2 extra charge for the guac.  Meat is low grade and is tough.\n\nBartender was shady.  She hit on my bf once when I went to get food and another time when I went to the restroom.	negative
My girlfriend and I planned our trip to Vegas down to the minute.  We left nothing to chance and did extensive research.  It was her first trip to Vegas (I had been before) and besides, she's a planner.  So when looking into nightclubs, we wanted to find 2, one for Friday and one for Saturday, that we HAD to see, and then one or two more to go to after if it turned out the first wasn't all it was cracked up to be or if we just wanted to check out something else.\n\nFriday night was XS and we were disappointed.  We left after 90 minutes or so and headed to The Act, which we loved.  Our second night was going to be an \""off-strip\"" night.  Firstly, we wanted to check our as many rooftop lounges and clubs for comparison, and between Rio and Palms, there's like 3 or 4.  And in our research, Voodoo looked like the best, so our first club Sat was Voodoo, and our backup was Ghostbar in Palms.  We never left Voodoo.\n\nFirstly, you have to start with the view.  Voodoo has 2 outdoor levels, and both have fantastic views.  We were there in mid April, so the weather was perfect.  The inside of the club was nice - maybe not the fanciest or coolest place, but it was upscale.  Dance floor was a bit small.  Regardless, there was no one inside - why would you be for a place like this.  When you could dance to great music and those views, it makes for a great night.\n\nSecond, music.  This is the type of music I want to hear.  Top 40, hip hop, dance.  Not house.  Mix some house in if you must to show off your DJ skills, but stick to what people like to listen to.  Admittedly, this was an older crowd and I think we (I'm 35) prefer top 40 over house music.  But you can dance to it, sing to it, and just have fun.  The only strange thing with the music was that the DJ for the lower outdoor level was playing the same songs as the upper level DJ, just maybe an hour or so behind.  I'm not sure if that was intentionally, but my girlfriend and I were on the upper level for a couple of hours, but then had an issue with another patron, so we decided to walk down the outdoor stairs to the lower level (it's only one floor down - still practically rooftop).  We got down there, and heard maybe half a dozen or so songs that we had heard upstairs earlier in the evening.  So that was strange.\n\nOur only problem was old people who can't handle their liquor.  There was some woman there, having fun, and dancing like there was no one around her.  Head and arms flailing all over the place.  Voodoo didn't get nearly as crowded as the other clubs - there was a crowd, but there was room to dance and move around - but regardless, club goers, you have to be aware of your surroundings.  Show a little restraint in your spasms.  This drunk 40 some year old was throwing her arms around and knocked my girlfriends drink, hard, right out of her hands.  The drink hit the ground and splashed on at least 2-3 other people.  So while we're apologizing profusely to everyone else, this woman went on like nothing happened.  Thankfully, everyone around us understood and we didn't have a problem, but this idiot didn't even acknowledge what she did, much less replace my girlfriends drink.  So it put a damper on the night, but we still had fun.\n\nTherefore, if you're okay with a 30-40 year old crowd that forgot how to party, then you should absolutely go to Voodoo.  Besides XS and Act, my only other club experiences in Vegas were Rain at Palms, which is now closed, and Studio 54 at MGM, also closed, so I don't have many places to compare it to, but I think this has got to be one of the best.	positive
Alex and Ben are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! Very helpful and understanding got a MVP from them and Ben sat with me and explained everything to me that I needed to know. Alex also helped my husband purchase and set up his new re build able one. the flavors are great our fav is M.S.G they are the best place in phx!!! I will not be going anywhere but here	positive
I work graveyard shift and order food from here 2-3 times a week. I have tried most of the menu and can't think of anything that I didn't like. The service is friendly and every time I call they remember me by name.	positive
My friend suggested I stay here while visiting her, since it was close to where she lives. The price considering the other resorts nearby seemed the best I could do financially, so I reserved a room here. No problems with the reservation, or check in. Nothing special really, and \""adequate\"" would be the best way to describe this place. They do have an outdoor pool for the kids. They also have a coffee bar along with bagels and some baked wrapped goods. Again nothing special and I understand that since I made the suggestion of having 2 pots of each coffee ready for guests, they are going to make that change. I noticed people behind me had to wait 10 minutes for a new pot to brew, and when you are in a hurry you don't want to wait that long.\nMy room consisted of a queen bed, a couch and tv and a little dining area of refrigerator with freezer, and some dishes and a small stove. I didn't cook anything while here so I can't comment on the stove.\nThe bathroom has a tub which I appreciated, however no shampoo is provided and I had to go down the following morning to request some. No conditioner is available either. Again, an adequate hair dryer IS provided which was nice to have since I didn't bring one. I didn't know this but they don't provide room service daily, only for people staying more then 7 days I believe. I requested more pillows the next morning, after a sleepless night of tossing and turning on my ironing board comfortable bed. When I returned that evening NON were provided. The next morning I went down to get a cup of coffee, but my coffee consisted of grinds. I told the manager at the front desk who led me back to where they brew the coffee, and got a fresh cup.\nI also explained how uncomfortable the bed was, and the pillows being so squishy they provided no  support whatsoever. He offered to have them flip the mattress over, but I didn't think that would make a difference. The pillows I requested WERE in the room by my return that evening.\nI probably would have to stay here again since it is fairly close to my friend, and not far from Scottsdale Blvd which is a major road for everything.  However, if I can find something around the same price, I wouldn't hesitate to go elsewhere.\nThe rooms are clean so no worry there, and the staff is very dedicated to trying to make your stay a good one so I can't fault them for that.\nHowever, I think they need to update their beds and pillows, because I am paying to sleep there, and would have loved a great nights sleep.	negative
Love the shrimp tacos here!!!	positive
I am very picky about breakfast and this place is phenomenal. Saw on Man vs. food and was in Vegas on vacation so we wanted to experience for ourselves. I don't usually indulge in biscuits with sausage gravy, but this one served over smashed potatoes was worth every single calorie! My other friends got different versions of hash and couldn't stop raving about it! Definitely worth the drive or cab ride off strip!	positive
This is one of our favourite restaurants in Phoenix.  We've been back numerous times, bringing family and friends, and it never fails to disappoint.  That's what keeps us coming back.  The service and food are always top notch.	positive
Food was subpar.  Clams were not fresh.  Service made up for a little bit of it.  Our waiter was really attentive.	negative
Ouch! I never wished I steped foot inside this bar. The female bartender seemed liked we were a nuisance in between her twitter updates. I wish I could get paid to update my social media status instead of serving my customers. Didn't even bother to stay to try the food. We left after one drink because of the poor service. It was not a pleasurable experience.	negative
I went to this place after seeing a segment on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (Food Network).  I thought that the fusion of Chinese & Mexican food would be good.  I was a bit disapointed.  The food was okay, but nothing too special.  The establishment itself was clean and the service was quick, so kudos to them for that.	negative
Exactly what you expect from Chick Fil A.  Consistent food, and great service and a clean restaurant.  Definitely the best of the fast food chains and this one is definitely good.  Only drawback is that is usually very busy, but that is a testament to the food and the experience.	positive
Checked into a room that was still being cleaned. Had to wait 20 minutes outside room for completion of cleaning only to find hair all over the bathroom. Very poor service and  service recovery.	negative
I was SO looking forward to eating at Modern Steak. A group of friends decided we should hit up Modern Steak for dessert, we were a large party, so we made reservations about 2 weeks in advance. We arrived and I was so impressed with the decor, I knew we were in for a treat. We were ushered  to a private room in the back. I was a little surprised at the set up, they had one long table set up for about 20-24 people (we were only a group of 15), and the only way to get from one side of the table to the other (or out of the room if god forbid you had to exit to use the restroom), was through a narrow, 12 inch space between the edge of the table and the glass wall. The wait staff quickly brought in our desserts, a selection of mini-cupcakes (my favorite), including carrot cake, banana, chocolate and of course red velvet. We attempted to make drink orders (I believe the wait staff took half of the table's drink orders), after asking the waiter for some wine recommendations, he said he would send the sommolier in. I think the sommolier came in with one person's wine. It was so chatotic it was hard to say what was going on. After 15 minutes, I had yet to even receive a glass of water, and did not get to start on my cupcakes until after asking several waiters (and getting dirty looks) for a glass of water. The cupcakes were the only thought that kept me going, I knew they were going to be worth it...what a giant let down. Save your money and whip up a batch of Duncan Hines Red Velvet cupcakes, they will be a HUNDRED times better. I doubt I will ever return to Modern Steak.	negative
Had a 430 appt. It's now 530. They said 20 more minutes. It's nice could use some upgrade to facility.  Overall service blah..Overbooked patients. I've been waiting for this second appt for them to advise me we may not get finished. What the heck, 3 appts for 3 cavity s ummm no its hard enough to schedule around work. After this we probably will not be back. Did I mention OVERBOOKED HURRY UP AND WAIT. NO GOOD PATIENT CARE. WE ARE NUMBERS.	negative
