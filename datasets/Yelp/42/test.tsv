I took my car to them to get the AC evac'd and refilled with freon. The guy who did it overfilled it so the compressor seized up. I paid them $82 for this crap job. When I went back to them they said they couldn't do anything about it and tried to shunt me to some mechanic they \""work with\"", along with a coupon, which makes me suspect there's shenanigans going on between these two businesses.  \n\nNow I'm looking at paying at least another $750 to get my AC repaired, with no apology or refund from Jiffy Lube for breaking my system. The company hasn't even responded to the email I wrote them after the last visit. I won't be going to their \""friend\"" for repairs, that's for sure! \n\nI've been taking cars to this Jiffy Lube for years and am VERY disappointed that they would treat a long-time customer like this. What happened, Jiffy Lube? You used to be cool!\n\nAnyway, don't take your car here. They'll break it.	negative
Finally a decent downtown Thai food place with good lunch prices. Actually, the first decent mom and pop restaurant serving an Asian cuisine I've been to downtown.\n\nThis place is a godsend from the over-priced likes of Wild Thaiger and Fate. It features really tasty and authentic lunch specials which run 6.95 and come with a small soup and a spring roll. I got a Pad Khing which was absolutely delicious and spicy. It's been a long time since I've had that dish that good.\n\nI also really like the diner experience for a small lunch. The only downer is that if you go with more then four people you will likely be sat in this attached dining room which has an awkward company-sponsored-increase-teamwork-dinner vibe. Although it still has the groovy 70s brown and orange lamps that are throughout the restaurant, which are a highlight fo' sho'.\n\nThe thai iced tea rawked my world too. Milkier then usual, but delicious.	positive
I love the food here. This was my 4th visit. Our waiter was awesome. Good sense of humor. We used a groupon, yessss Sir. Our waiter suggested different margaritas, my bestie had strawberry & I had a Cadillac margarita. All I can say is delicious. At the end the cashier tryed to over charge me but it was taken care of. I will be back.	positive
Hmmm, let's hire only one server for an entire busy lunchtime crowd and see how it goes. Meanwhile tattoo boy is staring at the waitress from behind the counter doing nothing. What is your purpose dude? You made it over to my table and put on menu on there, but you couldn't take my order?  I received water, but nothing else as I then decided to grab a take-out order.\nNO WHITE MEAT CHICKEN. This is a sign of a cheap place. Only the drive through taco joints don'[t serve white meat - you would expect it from a sit down joint. Waste of space. What do you do with the white meat of the chicken? Do you throw it out - cause if your smoking your own meats then the chicken comes with white meat. They are just too lazy to separate the meat. Can't take this place seriously.	negative
Bought a daily deal coupon thing for this place and enjoyed my dinner very much.  Staff were friendly and accommodating and happy to accept my coupon deal and didn't treat me like a second class customer.\nMenu options were explained, questions about cocktail selections were answered and food was delivered promptly.\nSushi was very good and tasted fresh.  Rolls were creative and overall were a good price/quality ratio while the warm sake really hit the spot.  I will be happy to return with or without a coupon in the future	positive
I loved it!!!  I was really surprised...  The portions are huge and tasted amazing.  I can't eat eggs (I know - what am I doing there right??) but I can eat pancakes, waffles...  I thought this would be another breakfast out eating the same thing BUT, they serve lunch for breakfast too - yay for me!! I had an awesome spinach salad with chicken, apple, cranberries, walnuts...  Breakfast salad : )  It was perfect.  My boyfriend had a skillet/scrambler thing and he said it was awesome.  Nice pieces of veggies, good amount of meat...  Service was wonderful!  (Don't miss this just because it's a chain!!)	positive
this was our second visit and again we don't  get it.  the food is not served hot!  the dishes have good flavors, but who wants to eat cold food?\n  we were treating guests at the first visit, and 4 out of 6 dinners were cold.  i thought perhaps with just two people it would fare better.  no, it did not.  the waitress took the dishes back to the kitchen to reheat.  unfortunately, when she brought back what she thought were hot meals, (they were slightly warm by the time they made it back to the table) she neglected to also get us new rice so that would be hot.  now we are left with putting lukewarm food on cold rice.  when we asked for hot rice, the waitress was happy to provide some---eventually.  she never told the manager there was a problem.  when i spoke to him on the way out,  i was met with a dismissive sorry about that and have a good night.  \nit is a nice looking restaurant with friendly waiters.  the tea was served steaming hot.  now if they could only do that with the rest of the dishes!	negative
Good atmosphere but bad food and service. The $60 Steak I ordered was burned and we had to wait another 30 minutes for a second one. The waiter never apologized for the inconvenience.	negative
This gym is the worst I've ever been to, but it's really close and I like the franchise because I travel.  Their hours suck-open at 8AM on Saturday?  Really? Their music is often so loud you can hear it over your own headphones, it has a bad odor, the cardio deck has a 30 minute run limit on all machines - you can't set the work-out time more than that - JOKE!  And the staff is rude.	negative
The lemon blueberry pancakes were pretty good. The food in general was good. The place gets packed every weekend, there was a wait when we got there. But we had to pack our food up right when it came to the table and leave. There were quite a few flies around the front area. Very bothersome, kept getting at our food. None of the staff said anything about it or even tried to acknowledge the fact that they were there.  I would have given more stars but it was very irritating to try to keep them away from our food.	negative
Bocata has a eclectic, funky decor and a cozy, dark, cavernous vibe. More importantly, they have a good wine list (creatively pasted in the pages of an old book) and a pretty decent by-the-glass wine selection. You can order a half or a full glass, which is fun because you can try more that way. If you ask nicely, they might even give you a tasting sample to try before you commit. The per glass prices are a little steep, but pretty on par for the neighbourhood (Old Montreal).\n\nThey also do some really tasty tapas-sized dishes. The salmon tartare is refreshingly innovative, the oysters are fresh, and there's usually some dish involving lobster.  They also occasionally hold special tasting events (for example, a tasting menu paired with Spanish wines, wines from Jura, sherry, etc.). Although it is technically a wine bar, they do seem to expect you to order food, and I would recommend going for a light meal or snack rather than just for drinks. It's a small space, so reservations are recommended to avoid disappointment.	positive
Went to Bob Taylor's for a steak and was disappointed in the whole experience. The service was very slow and the food was sub-par. It's comparable to outback, but a little more expensive. My wife had the smoked prime rib and it was hard to choke down because the flavor was overpowering. Not sure if we just don't have a taste for smoked prime rib... I had the sirloin and it was very salty and not a high quality cut of beef. Overall it's nothing special at Bob Taylors.	negative
Okay, so after a game of golf, we decide to chow down some burgers. We were told by the concierge to try this place and so we did.\n\nDisappointment. Granted the fact that this establishment is in the heart of Scottsdale, which is known as high rent district with all the attitude of hoity-toity people. \n\nHamburger/Cheeseburger and a side of fries for $12-$14 is outlandish. The fact that this restaurant had various choices in beer and wine rack shouldn't be the reason for such pricing. By the time the meal and couple of alcoholic beverages were consumed, average price of each person came to about $22 before gratuity. \n\nI suppose everyone has his/her own standard or benchmark. But $22 for a GROUND BEEF and 2 beer does not stack up well on price to value ratio. Either they need to improve their marketing by convincing the diners that, this is more than just a burger place or they need to convince the diners that they are eating something much more than a burger while eating a burger.\n\nMeat was good, no flavour however and was not cooked to order; I ordered medium but came out well-done. The staff was good to excellent--good waiting staff, excellent bus staff. \n\nEveryone in the party agreed that, we could have had a lot more for what we paid; or reversely, we could have had what we had elsewhere for a lot less cost.	negative
I love Mexican food.  El Dorado has decent food, but for the price there is much better.  Their guacamole is very plain and tastes more like mashed avocados with a scoop of Pico De Gallo on top, then guacamole.  I have had the fish tacos which were par for the course, and the braised pork adobo.   Portions of the pork were juicy and delicious, while other bites were dry.  It seemed as if reheated pork was mixed with fresh pork.\n\nThe service is slow and disappointing.  The guacamole came out fast, but the chips took 5 minutes.  The server decided to add chicken to the South West Caesar salad for my vegetarian girl friend.  After we finished our salad and guacamole it took thirty minutes for our entrees to arrive and being charged for salsa at a Mexican restaurant is just odd.\n\nThey do have a good selection of tequilas.	negative
When I moved in in 2010, I'd have probably given them a 4-star rating.  The location is great, the management (we called them the \""Golden Girls\"") was friendly and knew me by name, and maintenance response times were quick and efficient.  Any issues I had were politely handled by the friendly, \""motherly\"" ladies in the office.  They handed out bagged breakfasts on occasion in the mornings as you'd drive out of the complex, had popcorn popping in the office for residents, movie rentals available, and really went out of their way for the residents.  THAT version of the Cortesian gets at least a 4-star rating from me.\n\nThen, Alliance took over in 2012.  The Cortesian went downhill FAST.  They canned all the office staff and replaced them with a bunch of young know-nothings.  Every time I went in there somebody new was working who had no idea who I was, etc.  Not very welcoming or home-y.  Random employees coming and going, no consistency.  Maintenance issue response times at least doubled.  I was used to getting things addressed by the old management within a day or so.... waiting a week became common.  The maitenance guy was nice - but there was only one, so they're WAY understaffed now.  Included utilities became a thing of the past.  While they renovated the laundry rooms, the new (and cheap) machines, along with the new credit card machine, are ALWAYS out of order.  Every weekend there were more machines NOT working than there were working.  Know how they clean the pools?  THEY DUMP BOTTLES OF CLOROX IN THEM.  I've seen them do it.  The fitness center was rehabbed but is consistently closed for who knows why.   I can't even count how many times I woke up to cold showers and the hot water not working.  A cold shower is always a great start to the day.\n\nThey re-painted the exterior of all the buildings, but told us less than a day beforehand to clear off our balconies, otherwise our items would be disposed.  Luckily I checked my junk mail to find that email, but I'm sure others found it too late.  Maitenance/rehab work has been going on forever with the swimming pools, and it starts at about 7 am (as does landscaping), so good luck trying to sleep in once in awhile.  The office staff also treated my wife extremely rudely when she tried to retrieve a fob for the laundry rooms, which I was none too pleased about. \n\nRoaches, bugs.... I could go on and on.  It's amazing how the management and office staff ruined what was a nice place when I moved in.  I think the icing on the cake is their website, which depicts models and buildings not even associated with the Cortesian, and they call themselves a \""renovated masterpiece\"" on it.  So add false advertising to the list.  Very glad to be out.	negative
This place is amazing! Top notch burgers, amazing Mac n Cheese, a whole slew of great beers, and a ton of big screen TVs! On top of that, service is EXCELLENT, as is the management! Servers are free to wear whatever sports team's apparel they choose, adding to the melting pot experience that is Old Scottsdale. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a good solid burger or sandwich, a good beer, and a great place to unwind on the patio under the cooling misters. Prices aren't bad either, especially for the experience. I WILL be back!	positive
I've tried most of the menu items. I think the best is the halloumi (vegetarian) one. The batter is lightly spiced and really good. The cheese is really delicious especially when it's hot enough. When it cools down the cheese becomes dry, and rubbery.	positive
I went to Dr. Zenner for a couple of years and never got much out of it besides my meds refill. Very rude office staff what there is of it. He spent to much time talking about himself and current events than asking me my issues. I was just glad when I got out of there and didn't have to come back for 4 months.	negative
The food was average. There wasn't anything special that set them apart from other steak houses. I ordered the braised lobster while my friend ordered the rib eye. We shared so we can both have a surf n turf kind of meal. The steak was ok. I felt it need a little more seasoning. The lobster was overcooked. It was a chewy mess. My mom got the rack of lamb. She hardly had anything on her plate after she trimmed off the fat. The sides were horribly bland. We got the spinach and asparagus. I loved the sides at Brand in Monte Carlo. I was thoroughly disappointed with the sides here. Anyone can throw a high grade piece of meat on the grill and make it taste good but a good chef can make something boring like spinach taste spectacular. I was expecting somewhere between good and spectacular for $$$$. I would give this place 3 stars but the service sucked. This older black guy waited on us and he neglected us the whole night. He never once refilled my coke. Not once in the 2 hours we were there. He also dropped off dessert menus on our table and didn't return for another 30 mins to take our order. Unfortunately by then we were just over it. I'm pretty understanding when a place is super busy or short staffed but it was neither. I would not recommend this place to anyone esp since there are so many good places to eat in Vegas.	negative
This is my first ever time trying this chain.  I am pleasantly surprised!!! MUCH better than \""Taco Hell\"".  My fixin's were fresh, the meat was well seasoned.  I was afraid to try it because fat Mexican food can be really gross.  I'm not opposed to pulling into another one of these drive thrus in the future now! Food is 3/5 but with their affordable menu pricing I added a star.  Where else can you get lunch for under $5!!!	positive
I LOVE Sam's Town! I am not a local and have been coming here for 8 years.  I love everything about it.  \nIf you want to stay out of the Vegas heat Sam's Town has plenty to do without leaving the casino.\nLarge Bowling Alley\nMulti plex theater\nArcade\npool and hot tub\nTons of dining options\nIndoor park with waterfalls, creek, \""animals\"", water show, and laser show when it gets dark. The roof if all glass so there is a ton of natural light coming in on the park.\nVarious entertainment\nBingo\nAnd of course gambling\nThe rooms have always been clean and modern and the suites have a good amount of space. Ask for a park view room and you won't be disappointed.\nThe run a FREE shuttle to the strip and downtown several times a day.\nAlways plenty of parking if you park yourself.\nRight across the street is Wal-Mart incase you forgot something.	positive
As you will guess by its name, Gourmet Pasta doesn't just specialise in Italian food, but in pasta alone and this could be where the secret of its success lies.  The menu is extensive and it always takes me at least ten minutes to decide which dish to try as they all look, sound and smell amazing.  They serve the usual carbonara, bolognese and lasagne, but also lesser known and more original sauces like roasted red pepper and tomato and a special anchovy and chilli spaghetti.  \nWhat's more is that all the pasta is completely fresh and made to order.  This, combined with the fresh ingredients used in the sauces, makes each dish taste all the better.  Further, the service is quick and welcoming, depite it getting quite busy around lunch and dinner time.  The icing on the cake is that it's incredibly cheap for the quality of the food.  Most of the dishes are sold at under \u00a35 and the portions are far from stingy.  \nI honestly cannot fault this place from any perspective and urge anyone with an interest in a cheap, tasty dinner to visit it soon.	positive
2.8 stars. \n\nKitchen seems to emphasize quantity over quality. Was hoping for a more Southern-themed menu but offerings seemed fairly standard, boring presentation. \n\nChicken & waffles wasn't overly impressive - chicken was v. tender, lightly breaded, paired w/a standard Belgian waffle. Omelette was gigantic, portioned to share.\n\nBreakfast menu here: https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.mirage.com/files/bb_kings_blues_breakfast_menu.pdf&pli=1\n\nFYI bankruptcy dispute 2/25/11\nhttp://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/feb/25/bankrupt-blues-club-mirage-invoicing-dispute/	negative
What happened lotus cuisine? You used to be OK but now you just don't care anymore. The last 3 dishes I've ordered from you tasted awful and the local me in in particular had as much flavor and eye appeal as a cup of water. You no longer deserve my business.	negative
Finally, North Scottsdale has a fast food Mexican restaurant!!! Not Sure if it ever really needed one?? Okay food, Nothing that stands out... I tried their Signature Carne' Asada Taco's and a Cheese Quesadilla with their Grilled chicken... Good choices.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to get there, I just happen to have to drive past it, at least twice a day during the week, and still have only been there on one occasion.  I would agree with another reviewer, the staff is indifferent, and does act like  you are intruding on their time.	negative
Delightful atmosphere that is full of color and wonderful design. Mariachis were playing tableside which made the atmosphere fun! You immediately think good food is ahead....\n\nThe food....not so great. The food was very bland. The chips did not seem homemade. The menu suggests wonderful flavors in their food, but there actually  wasn't any pizazz or flavor to anything we had. Don't pay extra to try any of the salsas....bleh.\n\nThe service was horrible. The waiter did not know the menu nor could he make recommendations as to what the best food was on the menu. I flat out asked him what was most popular and he pointed out a salad. He didn't understand us when we asked questions and he did get some of our order wrong. \n\nI am really shocked how packed it was considering the flavors weren't good. We had tacos, quesadillas, beans/rice and tried various salsas. If you like authentic Mexican Food native to Arizona, this isn't the place for you. \n\nThe food was overpriced and the drinks seemed reasonably priced. I will not go back to this place.	negative
So I've now stayed at MGM, TheHotel at Mandalay Bay, Golden Nugget, and now the Wynn.  I have mixed feelings about my stay.  Obviously the bed was so comfortable that I wanted to buy it in the Home Store.  But instead bought my queen bed at Macys for about 1100 dollars cheaper.   We arrived late and check-in was a breeze.   It was checking out the day after XMAS that took about 30 mins.  The room service was top notch.  Probably the best I've ever experienced.  I'm still dreaming about that lobster the first night i was there.  I just felt like I wanted it to be breathe taking and I was surprised that my bathtub at TheHotel was larger.  I was surprised that there weren't more activities besides the nightclubs around XMAS time.  I tipped 20 bucks to see if I could get a better room but I realized later I don't think it worked.  I prebooked on booking.com months in advance.  The location on the strip I like a lot because you just start walking and not feeling like you're really far and you can hop on the bus.  It gorgeous inside.  I just get the feeling that maybe you get more perks with the towers or the nicer suites.   That maybe just getting a regular room here at the Wynn, can you get a really nice suite elsewhere.  And even for us working people paying 700-800 for 3 nights is a lot (w/o room service included, and the spa) we just want the works.  I'll def be back.  I know my boyfriend who is vegan, was happy to have the options, but felt like it wasn't actually that great tasting of what he tried between Tableau, room service, and the buffet.\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm a fan and had a great time.  I just don't know if we really got our moneys worth.\n\nAnd I hope they put an ice cream parlour somewhere in the Wynn because you have to try their homemade ice cream for room service!!!	positive
One Sunday afternoon, my boyfriend and I couldn't decide what to eat. And so we searched on Yelp Japanese. And came across Shabu Shabu less than 2 miles away from where we were. We were like sure why not, we've never tried Shabu Shabu. We entered into a small restaurant with burner tables. The room had to be big enough for 30-40 people. And it was not so busy, which was a plus being such a small restaurant. \n\nWe had no clue what to order or how it worked, but the kind lady was nice enough to explain. Luckily there was an expert couple sitting two tables away from us to further demonstrate and explain each step when the waitress was not available to answer our 1000 questions. \n\nWe ordered the original shabu shabu sauce with chicken and shrimp. It came with vegetables and noodles. We had a fun experience cooking our food in the pot of boiling water and seaweed. Slowly you add all the ingredients to cook all at the same time, instead of waiting hahaha. It was our first time and we loved the experience and the taste. I would love to try other shabu shabu just don't know where they might be in the Vegas area.	positive
This is place is like a stop, a stop where you get off if you want games. Hence Gamestation.\n\nGamestation is very well stocked, convenient game shop. Unsurprisingly it offers all the latest games, but more importantly a good selection of reasonably prices second hand games (which are often on sale). Its for this reason that Gamestation has also seemed to me better than its seemingly rival GAME. This Gamestation is particularly large and also offers retro fun, and video game spin off merchandise like T-Shirts and toys, which if you ask me are overpriced and marketed to a special kind of \""collector\"".\n\nYou might think that GAME, literally mere paces down the road, might make for stiff competition, but don't be fooled. GAME now owns Gamestation. If you want small independent game shops, you have to look hard. Fortunately Edinburgh has its very own \""Chips\"" on Nicholson Street.\n\nThe only real competition that Gamestation has is the online market, particularly second hand games from Amazon and Play, but as its stands it managing to compete on that front at least. And at least here you can browse, speak to real flesh and blood people, and sometimes come across great deals you weren't expecting.	positive
Went here just a couple of days ago for my first time. i'll start out with the service first. Our waitress was friendly, funny and on the ball! There was never a moment during our entire meal that we were sitting there waiting for her to show up to refill a drink or help us. And I also want to make note of the fact that each waiter/waitress was dressed in white from head to toe and not one uniform that we saw was out of place. Each person was dressed perfectly without a stain or blemish on their clothing. And for anyone that has worked in food service you know this isn't an easy thing to do. \n\nWe ordered appetizers to start out the meal, crab wontons and the warm crab artichoke dip. OMG let me tell you what both of the appetizers were amazing. The crab artichoke dip was perfectly hot temp wise, seasoned perfectly and there were tons of lump crab pieces in it, came with a toasted garlic sourdough bread what a perfect combo. The crab wontons also came out a perfect temp and that pop of fresh green onion flavor combined with the sweet spicy dipping sauce was to die for. \n\nMy husband ordered the filet mignon, it came with sweet potato fries, onion rings and he added a side of steamed asparagus. I myself ordered the factory combo that came with the steak diane, shrimp scampi and their house mashed potatoes. For me the steak was tasty and cooked perfectly, the shrimp however I felt was a tad over cooked and i've had far better scampi's from other restaurants, not that it was awful, just could have been better. Now the mashed potatoes, sweet baby jesus these things were delightful, they used red potatoes and there were still nice random lumps of potato throughout which I enjoy, the seasonings they used were on point and I just couldn't stop eating them. My husband said that his filet was perfectly cooked and that his whole meal was tasty, he even proclaimed that it was one of the best filet's he's ever had. \n\nNow for the cheesecake he ordered the lemon raspberry and I got the red velvet. Let me tell you what that red velvet cheesecake is amazing, I have an affinity for anything red velvet and am quite stringent on my standards of a good red velvet. The cake itself was moist and tasty and when surrounded by layers of cheesecake and crusted with white chocolate curls and garnished with real deal whipped cream this stuff is the business. I would go back just for the cheesecake.	positive
Happy Hour was awesome at The yard House. The Ahi Stack was great and $5!! wow!! Loads of beer...choices.. Good times!!! Great happy hour!	positive
Ordered the Kung Pao Chicken all day special and was impressed by everything I got. Wonton, Shrimp, Egg Roll, Fried Rice, and obviously my Kung Pao. I would've also got soup but the lady assumed I wasn't staying in so I just decided not to. My only complaint would be that there wasn't much chicken in the Kung Pao Chicken.	positive
I find this place boring. It's entertaining sure but I expected more figuring so many people talk about it. All you do is jump around on a thousand trampolines. Not for toddlers I don't think. More for older kids. We stayed a little then came to monkey joes. I find it to be a lot more fun and entertaining. Definitely keeps my son busy for quite a few hours.	negative
I wish I could speak as highly of this place as I do all the other restaurants in the Golden Nugget, but I simply cannot.  During our 9 -day stay in Las Vegas, we visited this caf\u00e9 several times and the service at each visit was more disappointing than the last.  After four visits, we decided that it was not going to get any better.  It is clear that the staff here is unionized and they seem to take advantage of this security by not bothering to expend energy to be courteous or timely in their service.  The food is mediocre at best (think Denny's) yet overpriced and served begrudgingly.  Note: the coffee here is plentiful but acrid.  \n\nOne visit stands out: after being seated by a hostess who didn't bother to speak to us or even make eye contact, a person (bus person, assistant?) inquired as to whether we would like something to drink.  We ordered two coffees, two water and two large orange juices.  This person said to us \""I can get you water and coffee but orange juice must be ordered from your server...pleeeeease!\"" It was obvious to both of us that we were being scolded for breaching an unknown and unspoken \""rule\"" about orange juice.  Our server finally came and almost convinced us that he wasn't totally bored while taking our order (including orange juice).  The meal took 15 minutes to arrive, sans OJ.  Later the server brought the check, reviewing it as he placed it on the table, and asked \""Did you ever get your orange juice?\""  We began to reiterate to him that we were told that only he could take that order but he abruptly walked away.  He did return with our OJ...just as we finished our meal.  We definitely could've lived without the OJ...and the attitude from the service staff. \n\nThis place is large, open 24 hours and very close to the pool but those are its only positive qualities.  There are other viable options on Fremont Street...especially for breakfast!  Du-Par's in the Golden Gate is the BEST!   If you do decide to dine here, my advice is to keep your expectations low.	negative
Please see Mr Ghetto - Walmart on youtube before reading this review. The wally world featured on this video is cleaner and better stocked than the one in this location. You have to wade through the small army of lazy bums panhandling (saw one in a leather jacket one time) before getting to the store or back to your car every time! I avoid taking my family here for safety sake so i usually go here by myself. That's only if I really have to go here unless I want to drive the extra 10 min to go to a better walmart down Craig Road.	negative
The translated \""Il Vinaio\"" is an ancient Italian word meaning \""polished turd\"". The pretentious menu, the \""Denny's\"" environment. The dated and uninspiring wine list. Fake yelp reviews, rude replies to yelp reviews.  Reviews that have no other reviews or friends, are obviously  fake yelp profiles, sad . Clearly unprofessional \""foodies\"" have no place in the restaurant industry, this place makes the Taco Bell next door  look bad. Keep polishing that turd, I heard the best way is to suck at both ends.	negative
I came to watch a friend's Roller Derby match. The facility looks like it may have been pretty great once, but doesn't appear to have been maintained well. The floos don't seem like they've had a good cleaning in a long time. Everything just seems a little dated and worn out.	negative
I love that most of their employees make it known that they would rather be anywhere else but here. \nThe prices are higher than most other competitors but it's the closest store to us so it's easy to get to.	negative
We were on a hunt for food before seeing a show at the Garden and settled on Emeril's. I love experiencing a chef's vision and was really excited to finally see Emeril's come to life. We chose this spot because they had a large bar and a TV and hoped to catch some football before continuing on with our night's festivities and get some tasty bites. \n\nUnfortunately, this experience has made me think twice about not only my fixation about going to a \""mainstream\"" chef's restaurant but also my admiration for Emeril. \n\nFirst, when we arrived there were two people at the bar and approximately twenty or so employees that appeared to be setting up for dinner service. The hostess up front greeted us and after explaining that we wanted to try to watch some football, suggested we sit at the bar. Perfect, so far so good. We were seated at the bar and waited....and watched as the bartenders and bar backs moved back and forth. Not one person greeted us for ten minutes...I understand that there is a certain amount of prep work required before the dinner service, but not acknowledging patrons is inexcusable. Once we finally were able to flag a bartender, we politely asked if we would be able to switch the channel on the TV to one that showed the game. The bartender said that he would have to ask the other patrons if that was fine which made sense but he was so dismissive that it automatically got my defenses up. Apparently, we were bothering him by asking him to change the channel on the TV. There were only two other patrons at the bar and thought that it wouldn't be an issue, but apparently it was for this bartender. Luckily, he made himself useful and actually got the channel changed but not after asking the other patrons which were more than obliging but then he told us that he would have to ask his manager...huh? Five minutes previous, he said that if the other patrons were OK with it then he would change it...now, we had to wait for his manager to approve? I thought restaurants were all about hospitality seeing that their business is contingent upon their patrons happiness and satisfaction. It was clear how our dinner experience was going to be after this....\n\nSo, we did this dance for about twenty minutes until we were asked what we wanted to order....He got the gnocchi and I ordered the Sea Bass....I inquired about an ingredient in the Sea Bass that I wasn't familiar with and instead of telling me he didn't know what it was, the bartender made up some lame answer about the ingredient. He told me it was something like a \""crustini\"". I'm no trained chef, but I know my way around a kitchen and have a good concept about tastes and ingredients. Not being satisfied with his answer, I googled it and low and behold, it was NOTHING like a crustini but an ingredient that included pork....huh? Do the servers in this place not know anything about the food? What a wasted disappointment. And unfortunately, we can't agree with the Banana Cream Pie either....bake sale banana cream pie would've be comparable. \n\nWorst service that we have experienced in a very long time. To be housed at the great MGM Grand, I would've expected better. I think we would've had a better experience at the food court. \n\nThe food was passable.....not good...not great and definitely what I would've expected from Emeril. I'm not going to waste more time and energy by going on a continued rant but I will say that every minute I sat in Emeril's establishment was a waste of my life. \n\nThe BFF's two cents on the experience? \""Douchy bartenders, slow service, no eye contact, food was meh, banana cream pie lacked flavor-tasted nothing like cream and overpriced\"". Sums it up completely,	negative
They were a little slow tonight.  Most people do not need a review of this place, you have either eaten here or have been told to.  Only 1 other fast food burger in Vegas better than this one.	positive
I hate to be \""that person\"" that gives this place 2 stars. Finally made it here for their famed Sunday Jazz Brunch. Perfect time of year to sit outside and enjoy the weather, while brunching. Brunch is my favorite meal. Sit me outside overlooking a gorgeous golf course and waterfall, doesn't get any better.\n\nWe were greeted by our friendly waiter and drink orders taken. He explained that we have the choice of buffet style as well as some entree items to order. There were 4 of us so we decided to order a few items off the entree menu to share. \n\nEggs Versailles-these were ok, nothing special.\n\nWagyu Hot Dog- don't ask, we just figured, why not. Again, nothing special, it was just a hot dog.\n\nBread Pudding French Toast- I was most excited about this, but the bottom was hard as a rock. You should be able to eat french toast without using a knife. \n\nSo we moved onto the buffet station. We all started out with the crab legs. These were so salty, 3 bites in and i couldn't even finish a leg. My friend agreed. Either they boiled them with way too much salt in the water or they were frozen.\n\nI tried the Shrimp & Grits, these were my favorite item. They were really good.\n\nThe buffet station was really small. They had some Kumiai oysters, some peel and eat shrimp, ceviche as well as build your own bagel and lox. Some granola parfaits, as well as a small cheese/salami board. And a very small dessert area. I didn't take part in the carving station. \n\nFor $65 a person, I expected a lot more. At least better food. I don't need an enormous selection, but at least make the food offered taste good. \n\nThey do offer bottomless mimosas for $25.\n\nFor the Wynn, I was disappointed. I enjoyed the brunch at La Cave ten fold over this place.	negative
Ballet Arizona has certainly improved thanks to the Dane Anderson...what does\n interest me is he....a.gay man?  Inquiring minds want to know...& I dont know why its  such a big secret! ?Arent MOST guys in ballet? Is it ONLY me who is wondering?	positive
I was given a gift card for CafePino from a co-worker who just raved about the place. So I figured that I would give it a try.\n\nA warm Tuesday night, I found the place pretty much empty even though lots of people were milling around and heading to the movies.\n\nGrabbed a seat outside and cruised through the menu. I would not really call this place cheap by any means\n\nI ordered the Pizza Procuitto and where the flavor was nice, the Procuitto looked more like Canadian Bacon. It was not thin at all... When I asked the waiter if this was normal he said no... yet did not do anything to rectify the issue.\n\nI might give it another try... but only because I still have some money left on the gift card.	negative
We've been trying out Cosmo dog park for a few years now. We actually took a break for about a year, though, because the park was always so disgusting that one of my dogs was getting skin infections on his feet after each visit. We also had a ton of problems with smaller-dog owners not watching their dogs and being generally really stupid with their animals, endangering both their own dog and mine. More than once I had dogs who were unknown to me run straight for me and leap into my arms to escape being chased by a larger dog. Sad when the dogs come to me and not their owners!\n\nI did talk to the town parks people about the small-dog issue, kids playing in the lake with the dogs (eeeeewwwwww!) and other issues, and they told me about their plans for the park. They do now have the timid dog area in place and more trash bins. Since we now have a second, younger dog, we decided to try it again this past week. \n\nMy dogs really liked the exercise and playtime, but the park is still really gross with dog crap everywhere. I didn't see a single person other than me pick up after their dog the entire time we were there. The small dog area gets used and I didn't see many issues with the little ones, so that was positive. But I am very concerned about health problems; both of our dogs got major soapy baths when we got home from the park. The parvo outbreak is significant this year and I don't think we'll chance going back. \n\nI also don't think people should be bringing their little kids to the dog park- there was even at least one family there with a baby and NO DOG. One guy made a comment as I walked by that \""now she won't ever be afraid of dogs!\"" Some of the dogs were literally nearly as big as me, and I saw some near-stroller-misses and some scary things for the kids- you may as well leave your baby sitting in the middle of the running of the bulls. \n\nCosmo is rated the best dog park in the country, and it could really be that if it was clean and if people had more common sense. It's not the dogs that are the problem....	negative
They did a good job on my pedicure but me and my sister both got a manicure and hers was sloppy while mine was crooked on a few fingers. It cost me a fortune and took forever. Everyone was nice there but to me it just wasn't worth it to spend my hard earned money on crooked nails. To boot they had a sign out front saying $25 for a full set but then charged me and my sister 35-45 each.	negative
Unfortunately no matter if I go to the galleria or Fashion Show it is the worst costumer service.  I was looking at a 600.00 Michael Kors handbag (at Fashion Show) with 3 sales associates talking and they never even looked at me. The whole store was like this.I bought nothing. I went to another department store and spent my money there. It's been like this for years. Especially the Galleria. I'd like to give a customer service training class. My guess is no one would show up.	negative
Beer is good, strawberry margarita is delicious!! The jalape\u00f1o pretzel bites are an appetizer worth paying for!! Wish it wasn't just seasonal, they should have it all year round! Food was so yummy! Our server Brittany was so nice and helpful! Definitely a place I would visit again :)	positive
Poor poor place of business	negative
As I sit a the gate 3, Terminal 2, UA1507 PHX-SFO in the plane with a 90 minute \""SFO Flow Control\"" and \""Mechanical problem of rivets missing on the engine cone?!\""  delay, I write this review. \n\nSky Harbor used to be my home base for a couple of years. It is a remarkably good airport given the tremendous growth in the Valley of the Sun. \n\nThere are 3 terminals: \nTerminal 2, the smallest and oldest, (United, Continental, others)\nTerminal 3, next largest and oldest (Delta, Northwest and many others, including international flights)\nTerminal 4, newest and bigger than the others combined, dominated by SouthWest and US AIrways (formerly America West)\n\nFor locals, there are the West and East long term parking lots. You can park in the West and walk to Terminal 2; East is much larger with an annex and hi-rise, and closer to terminal 4, but you need to take the shuttles. To help you remember which is east and west, PHX names the shuttles Gecko, RoadRunner, and one other I can't remember! \n\nFor visitors, to get a round the sprawling valley, you need to rent a car. The recently added offsite Rental car Center is huge and well organized into 4 floors with different brands on each floor, and a lot of shuttle buses that are dedicated to each terminal. It is about 1 mile from the airport, but allow 10 minutes for shuttles and loading when you drop off your car. \n\nThey have recently upgraded Terminal 2, expanding the security area and remodeling the restaurant. Terminal 2 has little in the way of food and shops. Terminal 4, organized into 7 separate buildings of gates connected with long hallways and moving sidewalks, has more food and shopping choices, but not on the order of PDX, or DEN. Because of the sheer volume of flights, Term 4 can have a long security check-in line, so plan accordingly. \n\nIf you have questions, there are roaming information assistant volunteers, wearing blue sports coats and hats. Signage is decent and most monitors have been upgraded to flat screens. \n\nSky Harbor is located close to Tempe (ASU) and no too far from downtown PHX. The edge of Mesa and Scottsdale are about 5 miles away, but it is 20 or more miles from other parts of North Scottsdale, Deer Valley and North Phoenix. Overall, it is fairly well organized and a clean airport with a lot of flight options, especially on SouthWest or US Airways, who use it as a major hub. For other airlines with a smaller foothold, you have to often connect through LAX, DEN, SLC, ORD or SFO depending on your final destination.	positive
Culinary Dropout is a fun spot for dinner and drinks with a group of people.  Everyone loves the pretzels and fondue appetizer, though I find it overrated.  The house potato chips are impressive though!  \n\nIt never fails that someone will order the fried chicken, and I'm not sure why it's never been me.  This restaurant is good at comfort food... the meatloaf is worth trying, I've heard great things about the burger, and I love the kale and sweet potato salad.  \n\nSome of the speciality cocktails are pretty good, albeit overpriced.  I stick to some house wine and I'm never disappointed.  Like all Fox Restaurants, their iced tea is lovely.\n\nMake a reservation if you're coming on the weekend, so you avoid a wait.  Then kick back, enjoy some live music and good food in a lively astmosphere!	positive
Food was pretty good but the staff are a bunch of zombies walking around with absolutely no customer service let alone personality. Out bar tender Steven acted as if he was in hell and provided a borderline unpleasant experience do to how non personable he was.  Not to pick on Steven but this was a common trend with ALL the staff.... Not sure I'll come back again.  Try smiling guys!!!	negative
I really enjoy the vibe inside Giant Coffee.\nWide open, bright and airy space, with an attached boutique that is good for browsing before/after ordering coffee.\nI really enjoy the iced honey-vanilla latte. Great for someone who is not a fan of overly-strong coffee drinks. The baristas are always friendly and helpful.\nA great place to come and study. It seems the best place to hook up your laptop is on the south wall, where the cool space-agey desks are located. If you can get a seat there, you're in luck :)\nFresh flowers at each of the tables, always a highlight!\nParking is not an issue if you park across the street at CVS.\nMy only complaint? Stay open a little later! Phoenix needs late-night coffee hangout spots!	positive
This place is so close to home that I really want to like it but there are just too many reasons not to.\n\nAs another Yelper stated the decor is nice post remodel and that is as good as it gets here.\n\nChips and salsa were brought to the table quickly and when my wife requested HOT salsa it was brought out quickly as well.\n\nPlaced our order..... carne asada burrito for me, fish tacos for my wife. They must be rationing fish in the kitchen.  Two tiny pieces in each taco which didn't fill the corn tortilla end to end. No flavor and not hot.\n\nThe carne asada burrito was small and the tortilla was like a firm paste. The quantity of tortilla outweighed the amount of carne asada. The beans were almost warm which puzzled me because the plate was very hot.\n\nMy wife asked for additional chips which never arrived to our table.\n\nWe were never asked if we enjoyed our meal. Im guessing that the amount we left on our plates spoke for us.\n\n5:30 on a Saturday night and the place is at 30 - 40% occupancy. I am pretty sure I know why.\n\nWe will not be returning.	negative
I live just down Commonwealth and absolutely going to Common Market to get one of there deli sandwiches!  The Californian is my favorite.  They have a great wine and beer selection as well and have wine tastings and other events throughout the week!  Check 'em out!	positive
Loved the food and the atmosphere.\n\nSplit the Chicken Parm and Lemon Fresc with my girlfriend and it was absolutely delicious. I will definitely have to come back soon.	positive
Wir warteten gestern 45 min bis jemand die Bestellung aufnahm. In der Zeit kamen auf unser Winken vier Mitarbeiter an den Tisch, die uns alle erkl\u00e4rten, dass es nicht ihr Bereich sei. Beim Bezahlen ging es auch ewig. Ganz klar gibt es am gleichen Ort L\u00e4den mit besserem Service.	negative
Called in a takeout order tonight & the process of ordering and going in to pick up was quick and painless. I could see parking being an issue for some, but that's just how it is downtown. Due to the small size of this place, I would probably only call in orders, but it's a really cute place. \n\nThe food was good and something I would try again. The Sweet Home Alabama was spicier than I expected, which was nice, but not as cheesy as I'd hoped. My husband got the Great Balls of Fire and he thought that it was good and the meatballs had a nice kick to them.  \n\nAll in all, a good experience. As someone who lives and works downtown, it's nice to have a new place that isn't pizza and is quick and easy to get takeout from.	positive
The 4-star rating is because of the taste.\n\nPrice:  150% of what you'd expect to pay\n\nService:  Excellent.  the service staff is friendly, smiley, and seem glad you're there.\n\nTaste:  absolutely wonderful.  The sauce is sweeter than most.\n\nI've only gone to the location south of Tempe Marketplace, and it seems kind of industrial.  I can EASILY overlook something like that for a lower price, so I'm ready for lower prices.	positive
I have been eating Thai food since 1983 when I was living and working in the region for years. I really never get the kind of taste experience in the U.S. yet I have had a good deal of excellent Thai in the bay area and elsewhere. But this place is obviously a cut above the rest.\n\nThe special spicy beef salad is amazing......they take an already excellent Yum Neua dressing and add hoisin sauce to create a masterful dressing like none other. It was killer.\n\nThe spicy chicken wing appetizer was also as good as I have had. We are madly in love with the same dish at Bangkok House in Kona and yet we thought this was even better....the sauce was richer and more garlic. Also a killer dish.\n\nLastly was the pineapple fried rice which has curry powder added as a twist....something not normally done in Thailand. The dish was perfect and so tasty.........but it was small and for the money they should be using fresh pineapple not canned. But it was still good enough no need to complain and even the curry powder was a nice touch.\n\nOur waiter \""Tea\"" is fantastic, great sense of humor.......and knows his stuff. Tea, if you read this thanks again for the tip on the special beef salad.\n\nCannot wait to go back.	positive
This place is pretty good! I wanted something decently healthy, cheap, and quick so I decided to try Jason's Deli. I got the turkey wrap and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was! I also got the broccoli cheddar soup which was delicious. The menu has a wide variety of food items to choose from which is great. Only downside - it was kind of pricey considering the amount of food I got. The wrap was realllllly small and wouldn't have satisfied me if thats all I got. However, overall, it was pretty good! Recommended!	positive
Enjoyed it even more on our second trip! Think it will be among our go-to bookmarked spots! The two item combo with rice is only $5.99 and is plenty for one... We each get one with different items and share. Love the BBQ pork!!	positive
Probably one of the best JC Penney's that I've been in a while.\n\nVery clean, and the staff is very friendly.  Never any lines, and well stocked and situated.  I think that the only issue with this store is its location which is tucked back behind Sears Grand.   Took us a while to find the first time since there wasn't any signs to designate where it was.\n\nYou know as they say... location location location.\n\nOtherwise, the place is great!	positive
Got the carne asada Jr. Burrito, it was dank! Although, it does suck to pay extra for things that are supposed to be included already. But besides that, Los Tacos was a party in my mouth.	positive
Just stopped in for some pizza and was so surprised they had white slices. I've been in AZ for 3 years and always miss good New York pizza. I would say their pizza is close to small chain pizzerias if you want a good New York slice try garden pizza in Goodyear but if you want a close to New York small chain \""Mario's pizza\"" style pizza an need a white slice fix give Gus a try. Got a special surprise the chef made some tiramisu and let us try it. Absolutely fantastic	positive
This time, I only ordered a boba milk tea, and I was completely underwhelmed. The tea itself tasted like my first attempt making my own milk tea when I was in middle school; I had to concentrate extremely hard to discern the faint tea flavor.\n\nHowever, the boba's texture was definitely on point.	negative
High ticket prices, seats don't recline, tiny theater and dirty bathrooms. \n\nThat sums this place up. If it hadn't been for a time crunch and a convenient show time i doubt I would have come here and after this won't be coming back. Charging $10 a ticket for a screen the same size as I have seen in houses with crapier surround sound to boot.	negative
I don't know why but Italian restaurants have never been on my go-to list when it comes to dining out. I think it was the result of dining at too many Italian restaurants that hardly impressed - heck, I could cook Italian better than that.\n\nBUT I'm a big fan of Vivace. It's Italian cuisine on a whole different level: refined and delicious! I've been to Vivace a couple of times before and I liked it - but we're rarely near Midtown so we hardly make it in. Big mistake. We need to make into Vivace on a regular basis!\n\nWe arrived on Friday evening after work and were seated in a booth with a great view of their open kitchen. I love seeing all the action in the kitchen. \n\nThe chef was nice enough to send out an amuse bouche of a perfectly seared scallop with olive oil.  It was a perfect bite. \n\nAfter looking over the menu - everything sounded so awesome - my husband and I decided to start with the fried calamari. It was crispy and tender at the same time.  Perfect calamari.\n\nFor my dinner, I ordered the primi of the pappardelle bolongnese with goat cheese crema and a big bowl of mussels!  My husband ordered the larger size of the risotto with crab and corn. When my pappardelle came out, our server brought out another dish of their special homemade pasta with squash, squash blossoms, and sea urchin butter for my husband because the chef didn't want him to be without a plate. Super classy chef! Now, when I heard sea urchin, I perked up, my hubby, on the other hand, looked terrified. But he ate all of it and is no longer a sea urchin virgin!  I also cleaned my plate of pappardelle :)\n\nAt this point we were getting full and wondered how we were going to get through our entrees. But when our entrees arrived, feelings of fullness were pushed aside and we dug in.  My mussels were perfect (I know, I say perfect a lot) but they were. A savory broth with the sweet tender, mussel meat. My hubby's risotto was perfect (again!) - I snagged a bite and declared that I was going to order the risotto next time. \n\nYou're probably thinking we passed on dessert but when we heard that they were rolling out their new dessert menu we had to try something! Something turned out to be 4 desserts: Cinnamon sugar focaccia with honey, marscarpone cheesecake with a homemade graham cracker crust, chocolate bomba with ice cream and a cherry inside, and espresso ice cream with cherries. OMG - I loved every one of these desserts. The focaccia was light and airy, the cheesecake had a wonderful texture, the bomba was decadent, and the ice cream was was rich and creamy.\n\nNeedless to say, we were stuffed. Our server was great, she was super attentive and very knowledgeable of the menu. The restaurant is beautiful and I love the modern decor. Vivace changed my thinking when it came to restaurants serving Italian cuisine. They've done it so right that they have ruined me for any other Italian restaurant. We'll definitely be back.	positive
Way too expensive for shooting guns.  They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.  \n\nFor $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.	negative
I definitely am a big fan of the panda express chain, and just so happens 2 be closest 2 my house. :-)	positive
We had breakfast there before driving back to LA. The food was really good. My husband had pancakes and I had a Mile High omelet. Yum!	positive
My friends and I went here because we were already in Bally's and didn't want to walk around searching for a sushi place to satisfy our craving. Walked up to the joint and you can tell it's small. There was a menu in the front and my husband pointed out the sushi boat and because we always want to eat a sushi boat at every restaurant we go to, we decided to go here. My friends never tried a sushi boat so they got one too. I was EXTREMELY dissapointed in the sushi love boat. It only had a roll of spicy tuna which was four pieces and a couple of nigiri (3 to be exact) and 4 pieces of sashimi which were the size of two of my fingers and I have small fingers. Then they gave us a couple of dumplings, slice of steak, two shrimp tempura and couple of vegetable tempura. The love boat which is suppose to feed two people could have just fed me alone and I would still be hungry. The love boat costs get this $55! NOT WORTH IT. Go elsewhere if you're in the mood for sushi. The only good thing here is the service. The waitress was very friendly to my friend. She was treated like she was the daughter or relative.	negative
One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Literally. We were just looking for a nice meal close to our convention center hotel and made a very poor choice. \nOnce seated, we waited more than 10 minutes for water and then had to ask for the drink menu. After finally ordering, the drinks/food did come quickly. I ordered the pad Thai, which was so bad I couldn't eat more than two bites...and it is extremely rare for me to turn away food! My boyfriend tried it as well and wouldn't even go back for a second bite...he compared the noodles and sauce to spaghetti o's...!!  His house chow main was good, but cold. I would have ordered something else to replace my pad Thai, but the server never came back to check on us. Eventually we had to ask for the check, though the server did offer to remove the pad Thai charge before we needed to ask. Once the check came, it had an extra appetizer charge, which then took a long time to get someone's attention to remove it. And once the check was finally corrected, the manager than hovered next to until signed (with her hand on the back of one of the chairs at our table!)! \nAdd to this the awful faux fireworks and drummer guy who spent half his time on the phone, and it was a very poor experience.	negative
We got this hotel as a quick overnight. We didn't stay long term and we didn't care about the casino\n\nThe elevators and halls smelled of smoke.  Our rooms did not.\n\nWe ordered two rooms ahead of time specifically to have the rooms side by side and two queens in each.  In fact, were charged an extra $10 per room for this.  When we arrived at the room, there was one bed in each room.  Back to the front desk, they found two rooms right away each with two beds, about 10 rooms apart from each other.  Extra star for the good customer service.  Remove one star for not honoring our request in the first place and not paying attention to the details of our reservation.\n\nThe room overall was fine, the tub was not clean as I would prefer.  Otherwise seemed ok.  \n\nWe didn't come to Vegas for the casinos, to gamble or anything else like that. It was a 36-hour trip and the one overnight in this place fit the bill.\n\nIf I were staying any length of time, this would not be the place.	negative
Great wings. Was in Madison a couple of days ago and I needed a quick bite. Loved the wings. Get boneless, Cajun BBQ, you won't regret it.	positive
Flaming Kabob, disguised as a former 5 & Diner, has been open at this location for a little over two years. Why, then, hasn't anyone reviewed it? \n\nThe staff was nice enough. The place was nearly empty at 1 pm on a Wednesday, yet service was remarkably slow. There were only two staff members in the front, but there were also only two other tables occupied while we were there. \n\nI admit, after being spoiled with the wonderful Mediterranean cuisine of Fattoush, this place left me disappointed and yearning for my favorite little hole in the wall joint. There were seven of us, so we got to sample an array of what Flaming Kabob has to offer. Here's a run down: \n\nHits: \nThe Tabbouleh salad was tasty. \nThe rice, with golden raisins, was very moist and flavorful. \nChicken kabob was spot on. \nThe garlic sauce was good, but not as smooth as i've had other places. \nTasty iced tea. (garden variety) \n\nMisses: \nBaba ghanoush lacked flavor. Consistency was good. \nHummus could use more spice. \nFalafel was overdone, almost to the point of being charred, yet soggy in the middle. \nSpinach pie (spanakopita) was awful. Ricotta cheese and some odd spice that we couldn't name ruined this dish. \nChicken kofta was an odd texture. It's ground chicken, but there's something else about it....\nPitas came straight from a bag. Come on guys, can't you do any better? \n\nAnd completely unrelated to the food.....the bathroom was out of toilet paper. Or seat covers. Or anything resembling a paper product that one might use after relieving themselves. \n\nFinal verdict: Don't waste your time or money. The prices are higher than many similar places- $8-9 for a lunch plate, the service is really slow, and it just isn't that good.	negative
I really don't understand the hype surrounding Dunkin' Donuts. The donuts are mediocre and so was their coffee. The only reason we made a stop here was because the Los Angeles location always had a line wrapped around so we thought we would give this a try. Variety was lacking and the old fashioned donut I tried tasted like it was left out overnight. Not fresh whatsoever. Two star experience for sure !	negative
If you know what Scotch you like, chances are they have it.\n\nI am just learning the nuances of drinking scotch. I heard good things about Magnums and I have been twice. \nBoth times I left a little overwhelmed...but I have now had time to evaluate my experiences and put some thought into it.\nI was in a real bad mood the second visit, but I my evaluation still holds when I think back.\n\nFirst visit - Ordered two (2) flights (samples of scotches, had four (4) in each flight - Magnums choice). Scotch was served in the traditional vinum and there was an adequate amount to properly \""sample\"". Their \""machine\"" was broken and we were each given a total price (seemed a little pricey...but  hey, it is Scotch.) I noticed the smell of AZ tap water in the glasses, but being a newbie, I was not sure what was proper etiquette. That was then...\n\nSecond visit - I was in a really bad mood and probably should have stayed home, but I did not. I was schooled the week before by a scotch lover with an extensive selection of fine scotches in his cabinet. I also researched the proper scotch tasting techniques. Armed with this knowledge and a little practice earlier in the week, I ordered one flight of four (4)  - my selections.\nI kindly asked if they could hand wash the glasses (because of visit #1). I was told they wash their glasses in filtered water and some other stuff, I don't remember. (I was fending off my friends jokes about how they were going to spit clean my glasses because I was being too picky), so I smiled and said OK.\n\nWhatever the case, they did not smell like AZ tap water. The glasses were rocks\\old fashion glasses. Picky? Absolutely.  If I am paying good money at a fancy scotch bar...and sampling multiple scotches...put them in the proper glass so I can have a proper sample!!! To top it all off, there was barely one swallow per glass. FAR less than what was gotten the first time. Not even a half a standard swig!  I ordered my favorite of the four afterwards and I would have to say the samples were about 1/5 of what a full order is...but charged for 1/2 of the drink.\nAm I wrong in my perception? Maybe, but I'd like someone to explain their flight pricing to me .\n\nThe place it too small to reserve tables. The first night they had three tables reserved and no-one showed up! I saw potential customers walk in and turn around and leave because there was no place to sit...and there were those three (3) empty tables with \""Reserved\"" signs on them. The second visit, there was one reserved table. We ordered, paid and left...and that one table was still empty. REALLY??? Wonder how much money they lost on the no shows.\nAs a side note, my friend wanted a specific scotch. He had me call earlier in the day to see if they had it. I was told they did not. Fair enough...Then we got there and my friend asked in the front where the liquor store and humidor are...still out (and for the last couple of weeks). he also ordered it and when she went back to check if they have it they did. mmmmm... This confused me..did they have a secret stash for regular customers and succumbed to his persistence and break it out for him, or give him something else and say it was what he wanted just to shut him up? Tooo fishy. \n\nI am disappointed!! Magnums is so close to home and I could see myself spending more time and money there. The interior is VERY comfortable. The bar is amazing. The tables (when you can get them are just like I want at home. Chairs are comfortable. They have multiple TVs hanging the walls with various sports on them (muted audio). But even better,  they have the center screens above the bar playing concert videos WITH the concert audio. It is obvious the owners paid a lot of attention to detail in every aspect. I SOOOOO WANTED Magnums to be that place. I am sad that is was not.	negative
We started off waiting for 20 minutes. And plus the hostess skipped us. We got inside and the restaurant layout is too crowded and too small. Third they got my drink wrong. The food was good. Nothing too special. Its better to enjoy if ordered takeout tho. Fourth the waiter did not even check on us. We had to get his attention for a refill. Overall not a good experience.	negative
I really do love going to Starbucks and this one is RIGHT by my house.  YEAH!  It's usually busy, but the line goes fast.  The ONLY complaint I've had about this one are the vagrants that hang around from time to time.  They aren't always there, but when they are, it stands out in your head.	positive
Came here after a long night at Tao. This place is 24/7 so you'll see tons of people here for some late night munchies. I got the #13 which was the combo Pho. It was delicious. The broth was amazing and the meats were so good. Noodles were perfect... not too chewy nor soft. Good way to end a night.	positive
Went back again this year and still great!	positive
If you're looking to build a computer and don't want to wait for an order from Newegg, then this place is probably perfect for you.\n\nEvery time I walk in here, I am always overwhelmed by how HUGE this place is.  There's a cafe in the middle.  A CAFE.  Where there are beverages and food.  So if you get too tired from walking or just plain lost, go right on to the middle and find this little oasis to recharge.\n\nPrices aren't too bad, but you can almost always get it cheaper online.  The sections are well-organized and I usually do not have any problems finding anything.  I've also built my own computer and work for a tech-related startup, so I know what a lot of the signs are pointing to.\n\nThe line can be super annoying!  They usually get people through pretty fast at least.\n\nAnother downer is sometimes the sales associates can be aggressive as it seems that they get a percentage of the sale.\n\nI recently went to pick up some items for my boss and an associate sort of scooped me up so I could find them faster than I already did (saved me ~10 seconds).  Then she asked if she could tally my basket under her name so she gets credit or something to that effect.\n\nMy trade-off?  \""Sure, if I can get to the front of the line.\""  That worked pretty well that day, but I can't promise it'll work for you.\n\nFun to browse as long as you don't get heckled by the workers.  \""No, I don't need help, thank you\"" and stern eye contact works most of the time for me.	positive
I automatically love a place where the owner playfully gives me grief for \""walkin into a beef place and orderin a grilled cheese\"". Cuz thats what I did.\n\nYes, Mama's has an italian beef/ vienna beef dog heavy menu, but they also have salads, and sandwiches not including italian beef (just in case youre not in the mood for it like I was).\n\nThe two guys behind the counter were very nice. They struck up conversations w/ all the customers (its nice when people actually try and get to know their clientele), and gave some of us grief.\n\nTheir prices are decent especially for the amount of food you get. My grilled cheese however was meh. It wasnt the melty deliciousness I was craving, though I have a little to do w/ that though since I chose 2 cheeses. Next time, one cheese will equal melty perfection, Im sure of it.\n\nParking for this place is minimal. Youll be lucky to find a place on the street in front or a space in the small lot in back (uncovered). Id beware of parking in the Tempe feed lot as all their spaces have signs specifically for their customers.\n\nAll in all, Mamas is a nice little lunch spot.	positive
For the night club only... It was way the hell too crowded due to the space being very small.	negative
Ceviche Classico, Limo Saltado, Tilia Malbec--Inca heaven in Madison.  All I was missing was Machu Picchu in the background.  Speaking of background....the music was Zamfir on the Pan Flute piping away covers to the kind of depressing, silly and sentimental tunes you typically only hear at Japanese restaurants in California.  (\""I am a Woman in Love\"" by Barbara Striesand, \""Hello\"" by Lionel Ritchie, etc.)  And they have a squeaky door to the kitchen that sounds like a crying elephant, which adds truly emotional, life-and-death mammilian notes to the restaurant score.  Gypsy Kings or some Archive and some oil on that door would completely liven up the mood, though. \n\nOverall, it was great (and my server was awesome, bringing out spicy, then spicier salsas so I could get my endorphin rush on).	positive
DO NOT STAY HERE. The cleaning ladies robbed us. They took all of our cash, and jewelry this weekend. All the hotel manager did is give us a $100 credit that was used up with lunch and one drink. I have stayed at many hotels in Vegas, and I was giving Ceasars a chance since I had never been. I should have just gone with the Wynn or Cosmo where I normally stay. Extremely disappointed.	negative
When this place first opened, I used to drive all the way from Green Valley just to come here - I was addicted to the amazing haupia cake (freshly baked at the bakery next door). The food was also good, enormous portions and the waitress Heidi was so crazy and fun. Over the years, quality and size went down significantly, so I stopped going a while ago. It's ironic because I now live on the SW side of town, and drive to Island Sushi, which is down the street from where I used to live. Anyway... \n\nI've kind of rediscovered Island Flavor because a couple friends still really like it. I resisted for a while but finally gave it a try, and the quality and large portions seem to be back. I think all the original people are gone, so maybe it was sold, but they got rid of that huge counter that took up the whole middle of the restaurant and added more tables and chairs. New layout is better, and I'm loving their furikake chicken even more than my old fav the off-menu katsu dip (chicken katsu dipped in korean chicken sauce). Even their mac salad seems better, although Island Sushi's potato mac salad is still my all time fav for plate lunch. \n\nThe owner of Island Sushi was working in the kitchen last week for some reason (no he didn't buy it) so maybe that's what the change is. Whatever the reason - I love this place again! Although I tried their new to me dessert - haupia ice cream pie. It wasn't very good - tasted like cheap coconut ice cream, smelled like suntan lotion. I'm sticking with the haupia cake. \n\nThey're also open a little later and  7 days a week now. Not sure if they still close for about a month around xmas/new years though.	positive
I rent a house and my tenants notified me the fridge I provided was no longer keeping cool. Not knowing what to do, I googled \""fridge repair\"" and found Appliance Works. I must say I'm very impressed! \n\nThey had same day inspection, were courteous and professional, and waited for my approval before doing anything. Their prices were also reasonable with multiple options for me in how far I wanted to go repairing.\n\nRecommended!	positive
I recently concluded a visit to Las Vegas. Initially, we were to be staying in this hotel. Quite frankly, I'm glad we didn't. The hotel looks old and dirty. The only part of the hotel that I found tolerable to look at was the lobby. This comes at no surprise since in order to check the hotel, one must enter the lobby and that's your first impression of the ENTIRE building. Nice way to trick people. \n\nTrying to kill some time around the area, we decided to play some games in the arcade. If you're wheelchair bound, it'll be very easy to get lost and you'll probably feel it's impossible to enjoy the \""fun\"" located above the casino. I would consider mapping out your trip of the place before you enter to prevent further frustration.\n\nAfter having a little bit of fun in the arcade we had to find out where to redeem our tickets earned. There are two areas. One area is only opened up on the weekends. There is no sign indicating this, so you'll probably stand there for a few moments wondering why employees are passing by you without helping you. Only AFTER we stood around for a few minutes and asked, the employee informed us of another prize station on the other side.\n\nThe wait there was just as irritating. We waited for about five or ten minutes. I was debating whether or not I should simply hop over and collect the proper prizes myself and leave the tickets on the table. Finally, someone showed up. No apology for the long wait, not even a \""hello\"" or a general acknowledgment of our presence.  More of a look of \""What do you want\""?\n\nI suppose the upside to the  trip was the employee let us slide with our prizes being 5 tickets short.  But that was really the highlight of my experience with employee contact.\n\nTo the employees: Smile. Guests like me are the reason why you're even employed. Be happy about that.	negative
I guess you get what you pay for.  I just needed a place to crash and wanted it to be cheap, and that's what I got.  My \""non-smoking\"" room smelled like a two-pack a day shut in had lived there, there was trash under the bed (nothing scandalous, an empty water bottle and a potato chip bag), the safe had been closed by another guest and the ice machine didn't work.  None of these things is huge for me, but things add up.\n\nThe check in experience was a zoo, with people everywhere, long lines and a strange amount of time to check in once I got to the front of the line.  The front desk clerk was very nice and seemed professional, but spent endless minutes inexplicably hitting the enter key, the arrow key, or clicking on something.  i thought I might unknowingly be in a comedy skit of some kind.\n\nI can't comment on the gaming experience or any other the other things Circus Circus has to offer, but after a 10 year absence from Las Vegas, this experience does not make me inclined to return, and if I do it will be to another hotel.\n\nThe only positive aspect of my stay was a very low price and a resort fee that is lower and therefore a little less stupid than most other properties in Las Vegas.	negative
I came a few months back and was completely unimpressed by the whole experience. We were hungry and needed lunch. The food was not particularly memorable, service less so. We didn't order drinks, although I hear they have plenty of options.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that it's a decent location to watch a game and have a drink. For me, however, the sheer number of TVs was overwhelming and my entire meal felt pretty schizophrenic. \n\nIt will do in a pinch, but not my first or sixth choice, for that matter. There are much better options at the Met.	negative
Great little market that manages to carry most everything.  Makes me sorry Madison doesn't more neighborhood markets.  Surprisingly good selection of produce, ice cream, wine and beer.  Many of the cashiers seem disengaged which is too bad since so many of the customers are from the neighborhood and would probably like to make eye contact with the cashiers they see regularly.\n\nBring cash - credit cards aren't accepted.	positive
Ive been here a couple times while shopping.. Good for draft beers happy hour and the mexico ish rocky point feel,.. cigarette smoke, stinky fish and stale beer smell. Its great until you order the food. Service was fast and friendly.  Knowledgeable and talkative with the hungover customers at the end of the bar getting their hair of the dog..   So I thought  I'd try the fish tacos grilled ( mahi mahi on the menu) . I remember eating here before a couple years ago and thinking it sucked. Nothings changed. The fish tacos tasted really fishy. Like reaaallly fishy. So fishy I couldnt finish the bite and lost my appetite. The black beans were dried up around the edges like they'd been sitting under a hot lamp and the rice was boxed... my grama is white and makes wayyy better... but either way the mahi mahi was so fishy i was concerned for the health and safety of future patrons.  Like Really fishy!  I sent the dish back and stuck with the beer.  The waitress was cool and offered the menu, stated she \""would tell the cooks to check the fish\""..,  but I still left hungry. Might come back for happy hour drafts. :(	negative
Well, I've gone back to Federico's several times since my last review and they seem to have improved.  Thank God that RUDE lady doesn't appear to be working there anymore, that's a plus!  Service is much better and even though the Monday-thru-Wednesday price of the tacos has gone up from $0.99 to $1.25, I still gotta have 'em, they're too good!  The flavor of their red sauce has changed for the better, and I like it more than the green sauce now.\n\nIf I could knock 'em on anything, I'd say that the restaurant needs to invest in a good salad spinner because the lettuce is way too freakin wet.  I like that fresh lettuce on my tacos, but I've had to start ordering it on the side or forgoing it altogether.  I'd prefer that they just make it right.  I absolutely can't stand opening my box to find my once-crispy tacos swimming in water and sauce, and after reading these comments about their refusal to admit their mistakes, I just might have to take another break from them if the situation doesn't improve.	positive
If you order sushi, ask for the secret menu.  The regular menu has regular rolls (standard stuff like Spicy Tuna and things of that sort).  We usually go for sushi, but I've been pleasantly surprised with the appetizers and the bowls.  The wings are very good (boneless, skinless tenders in sauce).  \n\nThe best part is the beer selection.  It's rotated regularly and is always unique.  The bartender is always friendly and quick to suggest a good beer if the taps have changed since my last visit.\n\nReally a good place to go have happy hour or dinner.  We actually started going there when we lived down the street.  We've since moved, but we still drive out of our way to go there.\n\nZen 32 it is not (but I think that's a good thing).	positive
This is a great place to unwind before or after going out on the strip. Great place to meet up with friends, cus it is not too loud. It is located parallel to the strip so none of that chaos. The food is delicious, but the portions are tight. I enjoyed the tierra y mar skewers, empanadas,   stuffed dates, fire fries with aoli and their complimentary starter sweet butter and croquetas. I recomment a pitcher of ANY flavor mojitos (more bang for your buck), I prefer mango.	positive
good store	negative
Was is good.. Yes\nDid it blow me away.. No\n\nI arrived here about 4:45pm Monday evening. It was me and the photographer for AZ Republic. \n\nI look over the menu and the salsa bar and man did it look good. I was hoping there was a sample platter or something but the best I could come up with was the 2 Taco meal. \n\nI opted for the Chicken and the pork, one of each. \n\nWhat I liked: \n-Chips with out having to order them separate.  \n-Tacos full of meat. \n-Staff was nice\n-Rice and Beans were good. \n-The salsa bar...way cool\n\nMeh:  \n-Corn shell was overcooked on 1/2 (one side)\n-meat was boring without salsa, good thing there is like 20 to choose. \n\n\nIt seems like the upscaled two hippies and it worked! 3.5 out of 4	positive
Pretty outstanding museum, I'm only going to add one little tip!\n\nStay the hell away from the cafe, they serve the weakest coffee in the world and it's mighty expensive. It's practically just water. Get your own from Starbucks down the street (i'm sure they'll open a new one closer next week).\n\nDon't let this put you off from what is this country's best tourist attraction.	positive
We had dimsum for dinner on a Saturday night at Orchids Garden. They serve dimsum all day from 10:30am - 10:30pm. Since they don't take reservations, we decided to go at 5:30pm - early enough before it gets too crowded.\n\nWaitresses walk around with carts filled with plates of dimsum, and they stop at each table. You pay per plate by category. As you take plates, the watresses stamp your food bill:\nA ($2.30) - our favorites are the Steamed BBQ Bun and for dessert: Baked Sweet Cream Bun and Red Bean Sesame Ball.\nB ($3.10) - our favorites are Shrimp Hargow, Baked BBQ Pork Pie, Shrimp Pasted Eggplant (make sure you get the sauce), Pan Fried Chives Dumpling, Shrimp with Rice Noodle, and for dessert: Mango or Coconut Pudding (with sweetened condensed milk.)\nC ($4.15) - Sugar Cane Shrimp\nD ($6.15) - Chinese Broccoli, Seaweed Salad, and the Chow Mein.\n\nThe standouts are the Chow Mein (even though $6.15 is over-priced for noodles), the Steamed BBQ Bun is the best deal, Pan Fried Chives Dumplings were our favorite, and the best dessert is the Baked Sweet Cream Bun!  Although we love the Seaweed Salad, the portion size is so small, it's not worth $6.15.\n\nSeven of us ate everything we wanted for a total of $82 plus tax. That's a pretty good deal! This is our favorite dimsum place in Vegas!	positive
now i've discovered why i've never given this place a bother.\n\nas previous reviews have attested-- service is non-existent; instead, its the peripheral glance of the same servers rushing past your table as if they were real fucking busy. really? we've been waiting for half an hour or so already. deciding that my ass had become numb from waiting, we managed to flag down a hastily walking server and finally gave our order. \n\nso, pomegranate margarita is OK. seafood kibis is frozen product, thawed, fried, not very seafood. lamb kibis is the less appetizing $12.95 unfolded version of much tastier gyro that can be found elsewhere for half the price. i suppose its good we were saved the task of having to answer to \""how's everything tasting?\""...because, quite precisely, everything is not tasting [good] at all. \n\nfez is one of those places that you go to, wait a long time (in hopes that the food redeems itself), and receive a server who places more importance on their strut and getting your friends number. ultimately you are left with underwhelming food, money and time, wasted.	negative
Small German bread shop that carries breads, pastries, and other German foods.\n\nThe store front was clean and organized and all the pastries appeared fresh. The woman working gave us a few extra donuts knowing it was our first time. \n\nI ordered:\n\nPretzel roll- chewy on the outside and doughy on the inside\n\nBerliner- not overly sweet like most jelly donuts found in American donut shops. Strawberry jelly is made in house but their is only a small dollop towards the end of the donut \n\n3 seed bread- all breads are made without sugar and personally I like my bread to be a bit sweet. Bread is chewy, soft in the middle and you can taste how few ingredients are used \n\nPrices are more than reasonable, customer service is great , and you can taste the freshness in each and every item.	positive
I didn't like it. Yes it was cheap but the massage style was too rough for me. I prefer the Swedish from massage envy. Save your money and treat yourself right.	negative
During the summertime I live on bingsoo. In fact, during the wintertime I live on bingsoo as well. Because it's that damn good. Everyone here is super friendly too. That may be because I come in 3 times a week though. You can even get a little frequent buyers punch card and after your 10th bingsoo or whatever you get you get a free one. Awwwee yeeahh. I've heard that the bingsoo they serve here isn't \""authentic\"", but who cares - it's to die for.	positive
after finally checking in at 6p, though we got to and started drinking at Vegas at 6a, we had some mean munchies. because we dropped a pretty penny at the tables already and desperate to consume our body weight in food, we flipped through those Vegas mags to find a great deal.\n\nenter Lucky 7s. $7.77... are you f-ing $hitting me!!!! the roar of my buddies as i mentioned this blessed bargain was greater than the roar of our empty, yet liquid filled bellies. contemplated taking the car back out of the valet and driving or cabbing. as you would imagine, the type of person that gets excited for $7.77 buffets does not do taxis. we chipped in for the $2 valet tip and headed down.\n\nthis place is in the Plaza in DT Vegas. not the most scenic of drives, and especially long when hungry. dropped the car at the valet where Mr Burns got my keys and positioned his frail body into my F150. \n\ngot in, paid and sat. it was more glorious than i would've imagined! they had 2 sections, american and chinese! $7.77 for a trip to heaven? i'll take two!!! the chinese side was typical Hong Kong express food. heavily breaded orange chicken and salty chow mein. the american side had fried chicken, mac n cheese, shepherd's pie, pot roast, etc. they had a carving station where the meat looked like it had to be dipped in gravy (overnight) to get back some moisture. oh, and the salad section could've used some gravy as well. \n\nneedless to say from that description, we gorged ourselves like death row inmates at midnite. i typically do 3 rounds plus desert. make it 4 for this trip. i had to. it's $7.77!!! \n\nmy only complaint about the place? it's far. otherwise, its awesome! c'mon, do you really expect a place charging $7.77 to get a bad review from me? IT'S $7.77 FOR A BUFFET! i got exactly what i paid for. YUMMY!	positive
Steak \""special\"" was 80% fat and lacked flavor, mussels undercooked, pasta overcooked, garlic mashed potatoes that set your mouth on fire, subpar service... Save your money	negative
No matter what featured flavor they are you must try the mussels... House of the rising sun drink is fantastic! Service is always very friendly and professional .. Small but comfortable environment! Encourage you to make reservations.	positive
Gigi's has focused it's efforts on only the superficial.  Their marketing materials (signage, brochures, packaging, etc.) are slick and glossy.  That's appropriate for this type of business, but what about focusing on the core if what it's supposed to do --- making great cupcakes?  And having a wide selection from which to choose?\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon I stopped in, there where six cupcakes.  Not six varieties, but six ACTUAL cupcakes!  I can understand the need to avoid waste and shrinkage, but six???  They're made of flour and water!!!  How much can it cost to keep a variety on hand?\n\nIn terms of the product, the cake was just average and the frosting was too thick and sweet.  The good news?  It was pretty to look at and well-packaged.	negative
My husband and I went here one night just to try out a different Japanese/Asian restaurant. \nWe were standing by the hostess waiting to be seated for about 15min with no one else in line but us, although we could understand that she was on the phone with another customer who had a lot of questions. Regardless, I wish the manager, who was walking around just asking people how their dinner is, could have given us any of the many tables that were available that night. \nAfter we were seated, the server took about another 15-20min to get to us and said she thought our order was taken already. She was nice about it though but I still expected a little more than that.\nMy husband had their beef teriyaki and I had a couple of their sushis. \nHis beef teriyaki was extremely disappointing as the beef seemed old and re-heated. It had an ok flavor to it but the quality of the meet was just terrible. \nThe two rolls I ordered were just ok and had too much rice packed into it. There was nothing memorable about it at all. Paying more than $70 for a meal that I would have quickly tossed in the trash was painful. \nThe one star I'm giving this restaurant is for our server who was kind enough to keep coming back to re-fill our hot tea. Other than that, I would never recommend anyone I know to this place to waste their money. There's a lot of other better Japanese restaurants in town.	negative
Beer selection was just ok. Chicken drum app was good.  Shrimp cocktail looked like it came from a frozen ring you get at the supermarket. When the fried chicken and waffle salad came out undercooked I was so excited that I could send that awful thing back without having to say I was disappointed and the ranch dressing was sour. I wanted to try something new but it was not good. The few pieces of waffles were hard and small like cereal. They offered dessert since I did not want to try anything else. Dessert was ok. They serve mini milkshakes with each one they were good. The pecan dessert was the best. The chocolate cake tasted like old cold store bought cake. They also gave a key lime ripe of cake that they should be embarrassed to serve. I love that type if dessert but it was bad!   Don't waste your time here there are plenty if excellent restaurants on Vegas. I love to find out and this was not cheap and not very good. I was do excited to try a Michael Mina restaurant and now I don't want to try another one. Ill end on a positive note by saying the staff was very friendly and accommodating.	negative
Not impressed with the quality of ice cream, long waits abb\u00e9 customer service.  I will not be returning.	negative
It was purely by accident that my friend and I stumbled upon this restaurant.  He had an Enjoy book coupon for D'Amico's that he wanted to use and I, having dined at D'Amicos (it wasnt good), had been dragging my heels about going back to D'Amicos.  We were really surprised when we arrived at found that D'Amico's was now Vino's/Ilario's Trattoria but we decided since we were there--why not try it out.\n\nWe walked in through the Vino's Bar door--the dining room is on the left side and there is a bar on the right hand side.  D'Amico's bar has a group of gnarled old men who have been regulars sitting on the same bar stools for the past 25 years and they dont want you there.  As soon as you open the door, all the conversation in the bar stops an they turn and look at you.  And they are NOT welcoming. \n\nThey really need a sign indicating which door is for the dining room.  Had I not previously dined at DAmicos and didn't know the dining room was on the left I probably would have walked right out of the bar.  I hope their management sees this; maybe they could do something about this.  The bar is actually really cute inside but ...Id be scared to drink there.\n\nAnyway--lets talk about Ilario's Trattoria/Vino's\n\nThis is not a 4 star restaurant but they get 4 stars from me because I loved the food and the atmosphere and the prices were great.\n\nThe dining room has had a complete overhall and it's cozy and romantic with exposed brick and murals.  We were seated right away.  Given the look of the dining room I was afraid dinner was going to be very expensive but everything on the menu seems to be $15,95 and comes with a salad and a side.\n\nI had the scallops which were pan seared just right and served in a lemon garlic sauce.  It was pretty damn good.  My friend had the seafood linguini with red sauce.  It was packed with seafood and excellent.  I highly recommend both dishes, and the mussels.  We had beer with our dinner and i was surprised it was only $3 a beer.\n\nPrior to our entrees they brought out crusty bread and olive oil which was fantastic and a little doughy, which is exactly how I like it.\n\nI highly recommend you try this restaurant out, and strongly urge you--use the door on the left side!	positive
This location doesn't honor internet coupons. They are very \""No can do\"" oriented..They don't budget on anything. They always make a mistake. They have no idea what customer service even is. Bad management!	negative
This place is super funny.. one hell of a joke. I placed an order at 4am... started getting anxious and curious by 5:30am. Called them and asked when the driver would be here. She said \""the driver isnt picking up his phone. I dont know where he is\"" she hung up on me. I called back.. the same lady answered. She then said i dont know Whats going on but the delivery hours are closed now. Pizza guy shows up at 6am. I open the pizza and the whole order was wrong & the pizza was cold.. ive never been so flabbergasted in my life.	negative
I went to Porte Greque tonight for my first time tonight (Monday Night) and I was very dissatisfied. I went because I had a coupon--2 meals, each with soup and dessert for 20$--that I received for supporting a local sports team.\nThe soup of the day was white bean soup. It was okay but nothing special. I ordered the Shish Kabab; marinated pork tenderloin skewered with onions and green peppers. I have to admit that the pork was very good and moist, but the kabab had only 2 tiny pieces of pepper and 3 tiny onion pieces.\nThe salad was an obvious cheap-out. A huge bed of iceberg lettuce with a quarter of a tomato, a few cucumbers, and barely any dressing. (Was it a store-bought dressing? I don't know... I could barely taste it over the blandness of the iceberg.) \nThe rice was the standard yellow rice that is served at so many other Greek restaurants. The potatoes were nice and crispy on the outside but bland on the inside.\nThere were no choices for dessert other than chocolate cake. It was okay, but I am not a huge fan and would have liked something other than chocolate cake. \nThe service was okay; our waitress was friendly and helpful. Parking was not an issue because it is a private lot.	negative
the jerk went out of buisness and kept our money!  thanks alot travelzoo for letting a cheap vendor be on there!!!!	negative
I stop in at Taco Bell about once a week, typically going to the one on McClintock & Ray. Today I was in a different part of town so I came to this one instead. The service was typical for a drive-thru, but that surprised me as I was under the impression that ALL of Taco Bell was pushing for better customer service. \n\nThe location on McClintock and Ray always has AMAZING customer service, with the drive-thru attendant genuinely asking how your day is going and occasionally throwing out a joke but always offering a smile.	negative
Ok so we finally got a chance to check Tao a club everyone raves about, and yeah it sorta lives up to its rep. We went 2 saturdays ago and the place was PACKED no Im telling u....PACKED!\nSo we roll up and it looked like an hour long wait but we got in right away, no guest list, no lines or anything due to the fact that the girls we were with just had to do was be flirty w/the bouncers and BAM we were in!!!\nSo we get in and this is how it goes:\nPROS:\n1) Decent DJ\n2) Drinks are good\n3) Go Go dancers are HOT!\n4) Lotta eye candy\n5) Club is nice really done up & big\n\nCons:\n1) if ur ugly or have no pull expect to wait for like an hour\n2) the main dance floor is INSANELY packed, I mean like scary u might get trampled PACKED.\n3) Drinks are pricey, but hey its vegas what do u expect.\n\nSo over all yeah the place is good times but I still prefer the Hollywood scene theres no place like home, yall should check it, hope this helps.	positive

This is one of the most horrendous establishments in Charlotte, NC! The staff is very unprofessional. They also smoke outside, at the front door where customers walk in, and I am not talking about one or two at a time,  but all at one time! The prices are ridiculous! They charge like they are Starbucks for coffee beverages. Please... This establishment disgusts me! They haven't kept the same staff longer than a couple of months. Which to me means that there is poor management. If you have the option to go to another DD's run there!  Stay away from this place!	negative
Worst Hotel ever to exist.  I know that the hotel around are a little more expensive.  But I would pay more not to have to deal with the front desk.  Most rude. Employees ever. \nAlso the rooms are worth about 20$ a night and my reasons would be the fact that my car got broke into 2 nights in a row.  I left the doors unlocked and they still broke the windows.\nWhen I informed the front desk the red head manager who refused to give me her name.\nSaid exact words \"" you park a brand new truck here what did you expect to happed\""\nI said what.  Next response was classic.\nHer words . \"" Well why did u stay here again if it happened last night.ans the camera are jut for us to watch most don't work .

Totally unadulterated indulgence.\n\nBeautiful pastries, chocolates and that world record chocolate fountain! A must visit for any sweet tooth.\n\nI had the best Ham and Cheese Croissant here! \n\nIf you love Nutella, the Nutella Brioche could be your thing, thought it was a bit much for me.\n\nJust the smell of the store, butter and chocolate is enough to get you mesmerized.\n\nFor photos and full reviews please visit my blog.	positive
The Good:\n-Smoke-free, clean, classy hotel\n-1 bedroom suites are very spacious, huge bathroom with a jacuzzi and two sinks\n-Can usually get an upgrade for $50 from a normal room to a suite at check-in\n-8 minute walk to the wynn / 5 minutes to the mall\n-Slightly cheaper than the other hotels on the strip\n-Concierge was helpful\n-There was a shuttle to Caesars but it was slow to arrive; it did run late which was nice\n\nThe Bad:\n-You pay a resort fee despite the fact that there are few amenities compared to the other resorts\n-Pool is small and not enough umbrellas, we were baking in the sun; it also took 45 minutes for us to get our drinks and food was eh\n-King bed in bedroom was great but the pull out couch had an extremely uncomfortable mattress and a maximum of 2 people can fit on it\n-There is no nightlife, great restaurants or pool party	positive
Sarah and Francis are an awesome team!  They gave me same day service, were on time, friendly, honest, and took there time.  There was no up-selling, pricing was great, but most importantly the job was high quality! You simply can't ask for more.  Thanks again!!!	positive
I took my husband to see this show for an early Birthday celebration because according to him all of his Birthdays have \""sucked\"". I would have to agree with him so I wanted to plan something he would truly enjoy. Musicals aren't really his thing even though I do drag him along sometimes so I figured I'd choose something more him. I chose the Fantasy show because he enjoys looking at \""naked ladies\"". I dunno I guess it's a guy thing! \n\nThe show is much more then women dancing around naked. The host Lorena Peril can really belt out a tune. She has a strong voice like Christina Aguilera. She likes to get the audience involved so you never know what will happen. Lorena also seems pretty nice. After the show during the meet and greet I was trying to sneak a picture of her signing my husband's calendar because I was too shy to ask her to pose with him. When she noticed me trying to take a picture she said, \""You want me to pose with him? ..cause I'll pose with him.\"" I thought that was pretty cool and the picture turned out really good! \n\nIf you don't want to have attention showered on you throughout the show don't sit in the front row. We were in the second row but the guy in front of us was the center of jokes, had to dance like a Chippendale dancer and he got to go up on the stage with the girls to be a part of their performance. It was all in good fun though him and his wife were good sports about it! \n\nThen someone unexpected comes on the stage ...a guy ...he wasn't on the poster! His name was Sean Cooper and he was hilarious! He first came out doing impressions of James Brown, Sammy Davis Jr. but his jokes are the best! He also did the rap during Lorena's \""Hips Don't Lie\"" number. We were lucky enough to catch him after the meet and greet to get pictures and tell him how funny we thought he was. He was also really cool about it. \n\n The show was pretty good even to the harshest of critics. I know because I was sitting next to one. This old guy was sitting near me with a stern look on his face for practically the whole show ( I'm a people watcher..so I always looked at him for his reaction during every number...I'm nosy like that.) but he even cracked a small smile. It was during the Michael Jackson impersonation though...go figure!	positive
went there for a friend's birthday party. the food is really good. loukoumades, lamb, octopus, eggplants, can't go wrong with those. didn't like the cheese dish as it was too salty\n\nit is expensive though. came out to $75 per head but we did eat quite well	positive
We came here for the shave ice & found out they have so much more. They sell all kinds of snacks, desserts, pupus, and even boba. I only got the chance to try the shave ice (with ice cream and azuki beans), pork hash, and poi mochi. They even have a kids table w/ toys & a tv w/ cartoons playing. I will definitely be back to try their cakes, malasadas, guri-guri, coco puffs, and boba.	positive
The gentlemen at discount tire were polite and respectful. They were going to repair my damaged tire for free and when they should have been going home on Christmas eve.. I really needed new tires but they were never pushy. When I tried to make an appointment for after Christmas they instead took care of my car at that time--probably an hour after close. \nWhat a Christmas gift. I am new to las Vegas and am glad I found this store	positive
Although this place has the friendliest staff I've encountered at a barber shop, the cut I received was short of okay!  Great friendly atmosphere and some funny barbers to chat with.  Unfortunately, I do not see myself returning due to a not so nice haircut and a price that shocked me when I reached the register to pay.	negative
Food is wonderful but staff was very rude!\nI got pastrami it was made perfect!  Tried the original also great! And so was tomato soup	positive
Music is too loud (obnoxious) and the internet sucks, slow. I love Starbucks but at night this more like a nightclub, but you know without the people. Currently using my phone to tether just to do the homework I can barely do because it is so friggin loud here. But this is just the humble opinion of one gold card holder.	negative
Lol I am doing a M****F*****G review on Denny's seriously! Well my EX has ties to this location so he feeds me on his dime. This is the spot when I want breakfast for dinner. I always order the same, an Ultimate omelet no mushrooms, hashed browns, and a bagel w/cream cheese. Um WTF they do not have a Denver omelet on the menu. Who in the world does not have the capability to make a Denver omelet. We are talking ham, bell pepper and onion.\n\nWhy not you may ask??? Well rumor has it that to cut cost, they did away with fresh vegetables such as bell pepper. They replaced it with a fajita style bell pepper and onion mix which comes in frozen. They use it for everything now, in 5 or 6 of their menu items. So there is no way to make a Denver because it would taste funky with that crappy seasoned pepper and onion mix (frozen). \n\n\n\nAnyhow, I like the free entertainment this location provides! The more low end clientele, homeless, prostitutes, and idiot and ungrateful demanding hotel staff management whom holds their weekly pow wow here. This Denny's is located inside of a motel and casino for the record.\n\nJust getting from your car to the building is an erotica of funk. Always some prostitute yelling at another, and the \""women of the night\"" switching shifts on the corner!\n\nI really feel good about myself as I am walking into the casino to the inside Denny's.\nI said Denny's is horrible, but not as bad as those call girls just on the other side of the door.\n\nThe one redeeming quality in this location is that they do have Awesome music bumping every time. I am always doing the booty mix a lot sway in the booth! Lol I do I really do. Then I get hit on by a pimp in which I told to take his baby nuts a walkin before they get let a stompin!	negative
I was introduced to Fat Daddys Ice Cream at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest, and in the blazing heat of a mid-afternoon sun it was a welcome introduction.  Here is served old fashioned scooped ice cream, and the scoops are quite generous, and prices reasonable.  In fact, a dollar can be saved by combining two scoops in one cup instead of ordering two single scoops separately.  Right on the food truck window where one orders, the scoops are described as \""Big\"" and \""Fat\"", as in \""2 Big Fat Scoops,\"" and the company stands behind its words.  The scoops were both massive--all the better to beat the heat!  \n\nAnd the ice cream was delicious.  The Rocky Road Ice Cream was smooth and creamy, and just chockfull of nuts and large marshmallow pieces as one would expect to be authentic Rocky Road.  Although the accompanying large scoop of Butter Pecan Ice Cream was not notably creamy, its flavor was true Butter Pecan, and the pecans were numerous and really tasty.\n\nAnother unusual touch for a food truck that I appreciated was that ice cream orders were prepared right after ordering and paying.  So that I observed a Fat Daddys employee scoop out my desired ice cream by hand and sequentially place both scoops into a Styrofoam cup before handing the completed order to me within a minute as I stood at the window.  Great, quick service!  \n\nKudos for Fat Daddys coming to the rescue on a blistering hot Sunday afternoon!	positive
Very nice place to grab a bit to eat.  Big portions friendly staff.  They should push the bacon more it was amazing.  Yes I know all bacon is amazing.  This was bacon squared.   Get the full body Mary and the biscuits and gravey or chicken fried steak.  They will not disappoint.	positive
Mood lighting. Hookup from the Pit Boss at the Asian High Roller place.... not that we gambled... but just flashed some pretty smiles and got VIP passes. \n\nMusic was good. Drinks were pricey, lounge areas were comfy.... dark enough so I could indulge in my lesbian tendencies and check out all the hot girls without being noticed... oh wait.... I think I was just checking out my best friend. Danced and watched the mood lighting change; yes I'm easily entertained. Had a nice selection of perfumes in the bathroom to freshen up!\n\nNot too many sleazy guys in there; always a plus in my book!! Great place to go with a group of friends; not a great place to go to hook up. =P	positive
Love Krispy Kreme  unfortunately Xavier has to be the worst customer service guy. No smile no customer service and when we asked a question he was impolite. No just fricken RUDE. Come in if Xavier is not here. Or not at. All. !!!!!!!!   \n\n\nXavier get a personality or go work in a mine where you don't have to engage people because you are not good at it at all .	negative
I've not hired Bruce, but have attended a few events which were catered by his company. Each one had a different theme - casual Hawaiian bbq, cocktail hour - and in each case, the food and service were just smashing. \n\nThe professionalism of his staff - at the grill, at carving stations, at the bar, at pretty much any point of contact - was just incredible. The host (various relatives) never had to worry about timing, keeping plates full or guests satisfied. I frequently heard other guests commenting about how wonderful everything was. Not one complaint, at least within my earshot - and I am the pessimistic type to listen for those. =) \n\nWhen it is time to cater our own event, I will be calling Bruce.	positive
God, it really pains me to have to update my review for this place. I go here a lot. I'm starting to think it's my own fault for putting up with crappy service.  I LOVE Dunkin Donuts, but the staff here SUCKS.  They screw up on my order 80% of the time and today was the last straw!!! GRRRR I am stewing as I write this. I was running late but seriously needed some caffeine and breakfast to get through the day. I went in the drive-through and ordered my usual, hot latte lite and plain toasted bagel with cream cheese. When I got up the window, she told me they were out of plain and suggested the everything bagel, which was fine. They finally get me my bagel and I rush off to work, Barely making it on time. I go to open my bag to eat my bagel, and it had no cream cheese on it. Ugh. Stupid idiots.	negative
I have been to PCCHH many times and I highly recommend this business. The owner, Nikki Remic-Bannon, has assembled a lovely team of well-trained and compassionate massage therapists and has created a lovely oasis in the middle of bustling Regent Square for your health, healing, and relaxation. Though this is certainly a business, Nikki and her staff make you feel welcome and cared for. I have been to studios where I felt like I was a dollar sign and could tell that the staff were not well-taken-care-of by the studio. That could not be farther from the truth here. I believe that Nikki is in the business for the right reasons and the people who are working for her seem happy and interested in what they are doing and concerned about the clients' health.\n\nThe two therapists I have seen most frequently are Chris Wright and Rebecca Aqra. Both are lovely people and great massage therapists. Chris can do some really intense deep tissue work (if you want it, of course) and has worked some miracles stretching out my head, neck, and shoulders. I know a lot of women prefer female therapists, but I encourage you to try Chris--he is a consummate professional and I was as comfortable on his table as I have been with any female therapist. Rebecca is a bundle of joyful energy who ferrets out problem spots and comes up with creative approaches to encourage stubborn knots to give in. \n\nTheir prices are not unfair, but unfortunately, it is the only thing that keeps me from coming on a weekly basis. If you have an injury or problem, or just need a hour of pampering, PCCHH can help you destress and get on the road to healing. I leave every time happy -- happy with the service I received and happy to do business with such lovely, caring people.	positive
The concept is good but the finished product is a mess.  \n\nLagasse's Stadium is a cross between Philippe Stark and a dive bar.  Go figure.\n\nSeveral televisions on several different sports stations conflicting with what the next person wants to watch.  Little crazy for those who go specifically to see a certain game at a $25.00 minimum.  Wouldn't be brave enough to order food but the beer is cold.	negative
If you are looking for a great wine shop, that you can also have dinner or share a bottle of wine and feel like you're not in Las Vegas anymore this is the spot.... Hidden in a Strip mall within Desert Shores this place has a deck that sits on the water...cool place for a change of pace...	positive
Yuk I asked for corned beef on toasted rye after a long wait i recieved a tough to chew pastrami on untoasted rye. I agreed to try it rather than wait. It was terrible. The waitress could see I only ate a couple of bites but still charged me full price. So I did what I never do I left not tip and left still hungry. Canters and Langers in Los Angeles still kick as.	negative
I stopped here for fuel and a car wash on my way from the gym to work the other day.  My car was in desperate need of a bath, and I didn't have time to visit my favorite Cobblestone car wash in Scottsdale.  \n\nBecause I did not want to continue to drive in shame, I figured a nice little rinse at the quick car wash would at least help a little.  My car is black and was so dirty it was starting to look like it had a nice gray primer coat on it.\n\nWhen the soapy cycle of the wash began, I noticed something flying above my car.  To my surprise, I looked up and notice several pigeons riding back and forth on the car wash \""arm\"".  To their credit, the pigeons looked quite happy going back and forth...back and forth.  I think one of them smiled at me. \n\n(A side note...where there are birds ready to poop, they will find me somehow.  I must have a poop magnet somewhere around me because it ALWAYS happens.)\n\nI am already stuck in neutral and it's still in the soap phase of my wash.  So I sit and wait.  I count how long it takes before one of the birds craps on my freshly rinsed car.  Of course, within moments of the dryer beginning and the green light flashes, I notice a nice little white pile on the hood of the car.  To make things even more enjoyable, the dryer smears the freshly deposited prize across my hood.  After all, who wants wet pigeon poop on their car?\n\nMoral of the story peeps...if you want pigeon poop and a car wash, this is THE place to be!  I was in a bit of a hurry so I didn't ask for my money back.  However, I did make a courtesy call later to kindly remind the owners of the gas station that they have some squeaky clean pigeons living in their car wash.  They didn't seem thrilled with my sarcasm.	negative
The Big Burrito is definitely filling and all the ingredients are super fresh. You get a wide variety of salsas to coat your food with, including a jalape\u00f1o and chipotle ranch. The al pastor tacos on Taco Tuesday are something few should ever pass up, especially when they're 2-for-1.\n\nEven at a pretty busy lunchtime the food came out quick and piping hot.  Definitely a place to visit most days, especially every Tuesday.	positive
I hate to be mean but this was the worst food that we have ever had in our entire life. It was so bad it was almost unbelievable. I think they are not busy enough so the food just sits there for hours and hours. I guess if you arrive at the right time when the food is fresh it would be okay but we were not that lucky. The owners seem very nice but the food is just awful, sorry :(	negative
There store employee/manager kristin is not at all friendly. She acts like she's doing a million things instead of providing customer service.	negative
Tonight, June 7th 2013, my family and I had diner at nous Trattoria di Mikes corner Crescent, and Ste-Catherine street, in Montreal, and we got really good service from \u00c9milie.\n\nI wish I could share the same excitement about Mikes restaurant and the two managers tonight, Steve and Charles. I find abusive that Mikes has incresed their beer pricing because of the Grand Prix week-end. There are two prices, the regular one for the beer and the even menu pricing.  When I asked to see the price on the menu, what was my surprise to find out that the Heineken price is not on the menu, an illigal practice in Quebec. \n\nTo insult me enven more, when I asked to talk to the manager he, Steve,  refused to take the time to come to see me, arguing he was too busy.\n\nI hav a bill with a beer at $6.09 for the first beer and $7.79 for the second beer.\n\nThe waitress , \u00c9milie, todl me that normaly both beers should have been charged at $7.79. the price for the week-end of the Grand Prix.\n\nThis practice is illegal.\n\nThank you Charles and Steve for not taking the time to come to see us.\n\nPS: By the way, it is not about the $1.60 extra that I was charged that made me upset, I still left 20% tip to \u00c9milie.	negative
I certainly don't come here for the pizzas - there are about 20 tastier pizzas in town off the top of my head. I come here for the incredible salads! They are a bit pricey, but you can get the full sized (2 meals in one), or knock a few bucks off for half - the perfect lunch.\n\nThey have such a fun creative array of options and toppings, like this one: \n\nMoroccan-spiced chicken breast with crisp Romaine lettuce, roasted butternut squash, Medjool dates, fresh avocado, toasted almonds, fresh beets, chopped egg, carrots, dried cranberries and red bell peppers. Tossed with our champagne vinaigrette. DELISH!\n\nI typically get the Cobb these days (it's low carb) and they have one of the best Cobbs in town. The avocado is always fresh and it's always loaded with meat and cheesey goodness. \n\nLook past the mediocre pizzas and try a salad - you won't be disappointed !	positive
I should know better.  I know.\n\nMcDonald's generally wouldn't get more than a three for average service, but you know sometimes you get that craving and for me, I hadn't had it in a loooong time.  Long and tiring day at work sometimes needs to be offered a little unhealthy nostalgic fast food.\n\nIt's even worse when McDonald's employees don't even care to be there.  Seriously, how hard is it to put together a burger?\n\nMy BigMac came without a piece of meat and without cheese.  When I pointed out their error, the employee giggled and shrugged her shoulders and handed me another one moments later.\n\nDumb.\n\nThen they had a huge banner that said \""Happy People Day\"" or some wierdness...signed by employees.  When I asked what it was about, they didn't even know.\n\nDuuumb.  You have a huge banner celebrating something that you're not even sure the reason for?	negative
Just awful, the service is horrendous and I come here at least twice a week, well not any more .. If they are busy or not they don't acknowledge you, and they screw up the simplest order \""Everytime\"" I'm patient I have been in the service industry... Sometimes was they just put your food in their toaster and forget about you... Never again ... I'm finding an Einstein bagel..  This place sucks!	negative
No! The rooms are decent BUT the hallways are disgusting. They need to tear everything out...wallpaper, carpet - they need to start over!  They're current renovating the casino which looks awesome. Be prepared to run into some scethcy ass people in the hallways. Oh yea...one night ALL the elevators stopped operating except for one elevator.  You had to truck up and down the stairs like a hurd of cattle.  Hopefully after they renovate the casino they will then concentrate on updating the room towers. Super old hotel but it actually feels more like a motel.  There was trash, food packages, FOOD, empty bottles, cigarette butts all over the floors in the mornings.  I feel super bad for the cleaning crews. Super Ratchetness!!!  OH how can I forget...one hallway you can actaully see blood splatter on the wall paper.  I about died!  RUN...do not stay here until they clean this ghetto ass place up!	negative
I wish that I had read the other reviews!!! My experience was exactly the same.  I purchased an item that they never delivered - in fact, they never had it in stock and now they have failed to refund me!!! AND THEY NEVER CALL YOU BACK OR EMAIL BACK!!! Now I have to work with my credit card company to file a notice of fraud, etc.... PLEASE beware when you shop at this website.  IT IS A SCAM!!!!	negative
great place - David is the man!	positive
I heard so many good things about this place and was very disappointed, first it was VERY expensive to eat for two people, better value and just as good BBQ next door. This was my first time here, and was over whelmed with the experience the workers didn't make it easy I felt rushed ordering and when I would ask questions, they would roll thier eyes....	negative
Never had an issue with the Filiberto's franchise. Always decent food, and always open! This one is on my way to work, sometimes at 4 in the morning! A good chili verde burritos sounds like a good way to start the day! In and out of there will fast, haven't ruined a order yet! Easy place to get in and our of there, located right off of Grand Ave.	positive
Huge place to shop for kitchen and restaurant uses...they carry lots cool things...check it out!!!	positive
Visually, the restaurant is pretty unassuming. Inside it has the classic decor of a local Italian dive with checkered tablecloths.\n\nFrom the start the waiter was talkative and friendly, offering us dishes not on the menu. When he mistakenly described the special as also coming with king prawns he promised that he could have it made that way especially for us. The chef also stopped by the table a couple of times to joke with us and ask how the meal was going.\n\nI was tempted by the pasta + wine special for \u00a37.90, but I couldn't resist the Seafood Stew based on Blythe's recommendation. The stew was overflowing with fresh mussels and fish for \u00a315. I'm not a big fan of salmon, so I was pleased that the stew had a rich variety of flavors, including a nicely smoked whitefish. The broth was tasty, but when I went to sop it up with the accompanying bread I was disappointed. The bread fell apart in my hands and had a wholegrain taste that didn't match the rest of the food.\n\nFor dessert I tried the Tiramisu and Banoffee pie. Both were fine, but nothing exciting.	positive
Love this place!  Super cute gem tucked away in a spot you would never guess.  A friend had to tell me about it or I never would have gone. Nice atmosphere with some fun decor.  There are lots of different seating postures so you can find what you like: sofa, lounge chairs, regular dining table, bar seating, and booth seating.  \n\nThe food is good as well. Didn't knock my socks off but definitely worth trying. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give 5 stars is bc the service is slow. We were sitting in the lounge area in the bar so perhaps they just need to get a server to cover that area rather than the bar tender.\n\nI will definitely be back!	positive
Love This place.	positive
I ate here for the first time last year. Any place where you can get RED KOOL AID DRANK is okay in my book. I had the chicken and waffles, why try anything else on the first visit? Would be nice if they offered a nap room for the post meal food coma. This will knock you on your ass.	positive
it says 'dive bar' on the sign, but plays deafening techno music to an empty room on a Saturday night. no tables where you can sit with friends. we wanted a dive bar and it's not, it's just a shitty small club. But even if I forgave it for not being what's on the sign, there's nowhere to dance if someone wanted to. So, not sure what it's trying to be, but it's not working. I felt so bad for the bartender, she was really nice. She turned the music down slightly and the guy working on the computer kept cranking it back up. So loud it was difficult to order a drink without hand signals from someone 1 ft away. Really strange.	negative
This review has been a long time coming. Casa Don Juan has been a must visit for me the past couple trips to Vegas thanks to a recommendation from a local friend. Why you might ask would I visit a Mexican restaurant with all the buffet choices available? Simple, as my Hispanic friends will say \""I'm an undercover Mexican!\"" I love Mexican food from birria, menudo, tacos de lengua con todo por favor, bring it on with extra tapatio! Honestly though my real reason for coming here is their camarones a la diabla! I've had my share of camarones a la diabla and I have to say they are one of the best. The spices and seasoning is perfect if you like food extra spicy the way I do. Plus you won't find any packaged mission tortillas here. They are freshly hand made and their guacamole is amazing! As another yelper stated they do take a souvenir photo while you're there which might seem tourisy but my friends and I did not mind. The waiters were friendly and attentive each time I was there so no complaints from me for customer service. In fact they brought me a cup of water even when I didn't ask for it and kept coming by to see if I needed more water thinking the camarones would be too spicy for me. Tsk, Tsk, little do they know this Asian chica loves the heat! My only gripe would probably be the fact that they do not serve jaimaca. I ask for it each time I'm there in hopes that they will finally say yes but not yet. For now their horchata and jugo de pina will do. In any event, if you're looking for a great Mexican food joint slightly off the hustle and bustle of the strip, give Casa Don Juan a try.	positive
WORST PLACE EVER, they sent me a bill the other day for $200 dollars from 8 months ago. They never looked into what my insurance would or would not cover and just screwed me over. Do not go here they are sales men and crooks and will give you an unnecessary hearing test and charge you for it, I'm 29 don't need a hearing test. AVOID at all Costs should really be 0 stars.	negative
Being delayed is never pleasant but a well appointed airport could help.  Things like dining options, free wifi, charging outlets and seating areas.  All things that this airport lacks.\n\nThe boarding areas are small and run into each other.  If everything is running smoothly, it's a tight fit but one small hiccup and BAAMM!  It's survival of the fittest.  Try balancing on your \""22 inch suitcase while hovering over a prized outlet while you feel the heat of staring eyes who want your tiny spot.  Geesh.  \n\nMust pack spare battery.	negative
Unfortunately just not very good. Not a terrible experience as the service was ok and busy place but food is marginal and price is on upper end for mex food. $11.95 for chips and guacamole... $8 for the house marg. $30 for fajitas for 2. That's all fine if it is good but sad to say most could make better mex food at home.	negative
we got this room through priceline's name your price thing, and we did get what we paid for. \n\nthe bath towels were shedding, room smelled old.\n\ni give it 1 star for the nice receptionist that gave us non-smoking room at the 63rd floor, and the pillows were comfortable.	negative
We bought our son a 2004 car here about a month ago. So far, we had to have the clutch replaced. Luckily it happened within 3 days of purchasing it so they fixed it for free. BUT, the car has been giving our son trouble when trying to start it. Dropped it at a local shop to see what is wrong. You name it - it needs replaced! Over $2000 to get it fixed. And some of these things are safety items and shouldn't be driven by anybody! I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place at all and I WILL NEVER EVER return! Total rip off kind of people! Not trustworthy! I can't imagine doing this to people every day. What kind of people are they? What a sad day.	negative
The yogurt takes just like ice cream.  The toppings are of good quality and include fresh fruit, snicker pieces, brownie chunks, nuts, etc.  A hefty filled cup runs us about $4.50 and is worth it.  You can get a card each time your yogurt weighs more than 8 oz and you get the 10th one free.	positive
Excellent extended stay hotel room with everything you need. Right off the strip so its nice and quiet but super easy to get to the strip. Complimentary breakfast was excellent with so much to choose from. The room was pretty spacious and every room has a balcony. We were lucky enough to get one overlooking the vegas skyline.	positive
I dont like to give bad ratings to businesses but this place is deserves a terrible rating! I have been here a 3 times, and everytime they have messed up on my order. Just Recently I stopped here for a quick bite to eat and I was throughly dissapointed in the service I recieved. The lady I dealt with was extremely rude. I would not recommend this place to anyone. This place delivers terrible customer service and below average mexican food. Don't waste your money on this place.	negative
I had lunch here earlier today and while the food is decent, something really turned me off.  I usually order water to go with my food and when I did, the server brought back 2 water bottles (for me & my wife).  I asked for just regular water but the server replied that his manager can only provide water bottle unless we also order drinks.   This nickel & dime-ing by the restaurant manager really put us in a bad mood.  The service was good (not the server fault) and the food came out fast enough.   \n\nWe order the Chips & Guac, Chicken Salad & Enfrijoladas (I think).  The food was decent. The total bill for 2 lunch with tips came out to about $31 and that includes the $2 charges for 2 bottle water.\n\nCongrats to the manager for forced selling bottle waters to the customers.\nWe won't be back to this place in the future.  I should've drove a bit further to Barrio Cafe.	negative
While the product was good, and very close to the real deal, the owner of this place, Jeff, allows his employees to hand out \""sno\"" balls to customers and other employees to literally throw them at anyone they want. I went here with my wife and 2 year old daughter, and had to stand outside waiting for my order, for fear of my child getting slammed in the face with a ball of ice. Absolutely horrible and unprofessional way to operate such a business.	negative
I like this place.\n\nI found out about Ryan's a couple of years ago and this is my go-to place for when I need certain pet products and want to save some money.  My girlfriend and I have great danes so when we were able to get a massive crate here for way less than other retailers wanted, we jumped on it.  If you have never been here it can be a little weird the first time.  Nothing is really labeled, though they finally put up category signs on the aisles so you at least know roughly where to go.  They have catalogs there that you can look at to find the prices of the products (nothing is labeled on the shelves) and you literally pull things out of bins.  \n\nThat being said, this is a great place to come for dog toys.  You can get a ton of toys on the cheap that are the same quality as other major retailers.  They do not sell food here but you can pick up treats if needed.  They also have a better selection of muzzles than Petsmart and Petco do.  If you haven't been here before, check out their website to get an idea of what they have before you come down.  It is a warehouse so be prepared that it is not air conditioned and can be a little muggy when you go in there.\n\nThe staff is typically friendly whenever I have been here.  I have not utilized the website as far as ordering but I do use it to compare products to other online stores.  If you have pets, I definitely recommend checking this place out.	positive
What a wonderful surprise! It has been a very long time since I had an auto place where the service was friendly, respectful and really beyond what I was used to or expecting. I had my alternator and breaks fixed, prices seemed reasonable and when I stopped in the next day to have them adjusted, they did so immediately and with a smile. I've been won over.	positive
Ordered the #1 right before close: mustard, chili, cheese, and onions.\nDog was out quick, service was friendly, but product was sub-par: small dog looked boiled and old, not at all visually appealing. \nTaste did not seem to include any mustard per the order board, but the chili was actually really good. Onions were weird, almost shredded to death instead of chopped. Bun fell apart halfway through eating.\nThis isn't the best food court I've come across, but there are better options here instead of this joint.	negative
Can't really say anything bad about this place, but it did not knock me off my feet. I went to use a Veebow discount at a restaurant next door, but saw that this was a lil more kid friendly so we stopped in. \nPros: Pizza was really good, not great, but really good. Salads was good as well, the food was not bad at all. They had a mac and chees for my son which I caught my wife enjoying as well.\nAll in all, we are going to help promote this business, because of friendly mgr and staff. They will keep seeing us there over and over.\n\nThis place is Good.	positive
Art is not trustworthy.  His mechanic broke something on my car (Not Tom, Tom is a very good guy and excellent mechanic.) and then got very angry with me when I actually (gasp) expected him to repair it!  The next time I came in he treated my wife and I very poorly. We started going through all our bills and realized he'd been overpricing us for years. After finding a better mechanic we were told we'd paid for things, fixed and replaced things we never should have.  We expected better after taking our cars there for eight years.  Art is a scheister taking advantage of poor older folks and families who don't know any better.  Do NOT trust him!	negative
Went in today not realizing that they had changed name and owners. NEW NAME IS HAPPY WOK. Ordered Won Ton Soup and all it was was broth, house fried rice and the house chow fun and NO flavor.  The new people were not as friendly and the son (?) acts like he isn't allowed out in public very often. Pretty awkward ordering experince. Off to find a new neighborhood Chinese spot	negative
4.5 stars?  Every person I know that has seen this show concurs that it works better than prescription sleeping pills.  I no longer have faith in Yelp as statements like \""Money Well spent\"" is a JOKE.  Caveat emptor with these pricey vegas tickets.  After watching Le Reve then this the first thing that popped in my mind was \""tourist trap\"".  Go to the RedBox, its much more entertaining.	negative
Very expensive and average. Every other restaurant in our casino was jammed so we went here. Food was ok. My shrimp dish was $25+ for only five shrimp! No pasta/rice or anything else with it. Ridiculous. To top it off, warm beer. Only upside was good service.	negative
I have never been let down by Back East Bagels. I feel completely comfortable just sitting and enjoying my food without being bustled out. Food is perfection and decently priced compared to other bagel/breakfast joints. \n\nI've heard some people complain that they do not offer wifi. I enjoy this but I know others want to be plugged in. \n\nAlso, coffee options are amazing. 6 different roasts and flavors and a variety of creamers. You know..if you're into that.	positive
Order the BBQ Pork, and as soon as I checked in at the location I got a free glass of champagne....allready off to good start	positive
Found this place on groupon. 25$ for 50$ worth of drinks, I mean who would say no to that! Plus I have this thing for tapas style foods so I was very excited to try this place out.\n\nCame here on a Friday night with my friend, it was extremely dead. First thing I smelt was smoke but hey, it's a bar what did I expect? Immediately greeted by Eric, our bartender for the night. He was very nice & attentive. He did mention he just started working so he was kind of clueless with the cocktail menus as well as the foods but I won't hold that against him!\n\nFor the foods--  this place is at the bottom of my list of tapas foods. We ordered..\nMango chicken -- nothing special about it looked like grilled chicken in mango salsa. \nStuffed dates -- The dates were so big! & was wrapped in a small size bacon that didn't match the portion size of the dates.\nCrab cake -- this was pretty delicious but the presentation of the dish wasn't appealing. When it came out it looked like a burger patty swimming in sauce. \nBuffalo wings-- nothing to say there it's wings lol \nCeviche -- it was pretty good. The chips looked like it came outta a bag that you buy at the super market.\nMeatball sliders -- meatballs were midget size compared to the bun. Tasted bland.\n\nCocktails & wine-- got the job done. They weren't terrible. \n\nOverall, I probably will not be returning. Me and friend did have fun there but we have fun anywhere really. Lol	negative
I have been to Peffermill a good few times to play football for the football supporters club. Although never really joining the team properly, I came along whenever they were a player short or needed some depth in the squad. I normally played in a five a side team that was not actually part of the uni and played at the Corn Exchange. \n\nI normally played on the astroturf pitches here and this means that you can never get a game to be abandoned throughout the year. The pitches were good quality and the changing room facilities were good too.\n\nThe worst thing about Peffermill is that it is a bit of a mission to get to, but this can't really be helped as there really isn't many other sports facilities more central than this.	positive
Outside of the fancy salons inside resort casinos in Las Vegas, this was the first and now the only nail salon I feel confident in going to.  I went to them based on other Yelp reviews.   I have basic mani/pedi needs and this salon is clean, well decorated and welcoming. I have gone multiple times now and continue to be very satisfied with my service.  Bruce in particular has always given me great service,  but all technicians and staff seem friendly, competent, qualified and grateful for my business.  I continue to simply Walk In versus making an appointment, but know the salon is busy and clearly popular....a good sign of happy customers showing patronage to a good business.	positive
The previous review is no longer the case as I just came here this weekend and ordered a cold cut combo with chips and drink combo and it was $8.00 and change. There was definitely no $14 sub. This place was full of Wendy's, Weinershnitzel, Noble Roman's pizza, Del Taco, DQ/Orange Julius, Starbucks, Panda Express, etc. This was the best bargain place to eat on the strip for both calorie and $ watching. Im so glad this place had subway..:)	positive
Gross!  Was so excited to try the Mexican hot dog and it was extremely disappointing.  I thought the bacon would add a lot of delicious flavor to the hot dog but it didn't.  The dog was tasteless as was the bacon.  Not sure how that happened.  the sweet bread bun was also very odd tasting with the hot dog.  Ive never had a mexican dog before so Im not sure if thats normal for the bun to be sweet but it really didn't work for me.  The whole thing left a horrible, awful taste in my mouth.	negative
We came here 1/1/09 right after viewing a traditional New Year's Day movie next door @ Rave Movie Theatre.  Since it was 10pm, it wasn't crowded at all.  I picked up a card right at  the entrance to the restaurant for a free appetizer with purchase of an entree (score!).  We ordered the fabulous mussels (usu $11.50) that came in a bacon cream sauce.  The entrees were delish but my dining partner didn't like the lasagne due to the fact that it did come in a cream sauce but I thought it was great because it wasn't thick & lasagne noodle-y.  My veal milanese classico was tasty & is lemony with (in a good way).  Our waiter, Allen, was fine, not weird as was mentioned in previous reviews but forgot to fill our water & ice tea.  Pretty decor, plentiful food, had a lot of leftovers for the next day so all in all would definitely return but I'll also ask my Italian colleague what she thinks	positive
$29.99/pp for an awesome 3-course meal? I'm all for it.\n\nMy sister and I got an e-mail from the Mirage advertising their prix fixe menus, so we made a reservation.\n\nThe ambiance is nice, but I think they could use more light.  \n\nThe service was great.  We had about three servers tending to us.  \n\nDrinks were awesome.\n\nFood was delish.  To start, I had the mushroom pot pie (SO GOOD), and Jenn had the crab cake, which she really enjoyed.\n\nFor the entree, I had the surf and turf.  They gave an ample portion of steak, but only one (yummy) jumbo garlic shrimp.  Jenn had the salmon, which she thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nFor dessert, I had the 12 layer chocolate cake, and Jenn had the butterscotch custard. Both were AMAZING (and I don't even like butterscotch).\n\nI'd recommend it, especially for the great price!	positive
I've always found large portions to be unappealing as my taste buds  hit the plateau of diminishing returns usually after 3 bites.  Stax solves that problem by offering 3oz sliders around $4-$5 and tons of choices for customizing them.  \n\nThe Moroccan Colorado lamb and the good ol' beef burger were nicely charred and full of flavor.  The sweet potato fries at $3.75 was not only delicious but a great deal given the generous serving.  The garlic aioli goes great with it.  \n\nI appreciated the no pressure service.  Even though between the two of us we only ordered a slider each and shared one order of fries, the server was cool with it.	positive
Perfect place for small children!!! Your leather lunged kid could scream and scream and scream, and would simply blend in with non-stop din of the other small kids and blaring televisions. Just like the  departure lounge going to Orlando at an airport!! The food is made for children, frozen boneless chicken fingers and fries, just like at home. Kids can and do wipe their hands on all surfaces available, so you don't even have to think about cleaning up after them. Everything is really, really sticky! Many families have found this place to be excellent, they fill the place. Bon Appetit!!	positive
Very nice facility that is well kept.  Can't wait to see a game with the roof open.  My only complaint would be that I wish they had more vegan friendly options. For instance, I attempted to get Subway but found the subs to be pre-made, which wouldn't work for me.	positive
Waited over 10 minutes for a toasted bagel. Finally had to ask for it. It was cold and nobody cared or apologized. The excuse was someone was in break.  Won't return for awhile	negative
The food is great as usual. And the service there never disappoints. Jeremy was awesome. \n\nFondue Feast. Lager and Cheddar Cheese fondue. The meats had the advertising Latin spin for the current Big Night Out. The dessert was dark chocolate with sea salt. All was A-OK.\n\nThe table next to us was inhabited by two of the most annoying groups of diners I've ever experienced. When we arrived, the meal was winding down for a mother, her 13-ish old daughter, and that daughter's friend. If they hadn't been so young, I would have sworn the girls were drunk off their respective asses. They kept screaming across the restaurant for the waiter, thinking they were going to hook him up with their cougar mom. I'm thinking that probably wasn't an option, as I'm pretty sure the waiter didn't play for that team. But hearing yells of  \""WE NEED MORE NAPKINS JEREMY\"" was enough to make want to throw hot bouillon over the wall onto their skank little heads.\n\nWe had about 15 minutes of quiet after they left, until this weird older couple was seated at the same table. The woman had a ghastly hat that looked like she had shopped at Savers for a hat to wear to the Churchill Downs. It was white with lots of lace and feathers and crap. And she left it on the entire meal. They went on an on with the waiter about how it was their 24th anniversary, we got to hear about restaurants that the husband was \""forbidden to go to\"" because of his flatulence, we were subjected to them listening to Jack Johnson on their phone, and had to hear their incessant nincompoopery while we finished our dessert.\n\nLove the Melting Pot, but maybe will go to one in a different area of town next time.	positive
Update: 28.08.10\nAlso hier musste ich erst einmal eine Nacht dr\u00fcber schlafen. So einen Service habe ich wirklich selten erlebt. Schnippische (meiner Ansicht nach schlichtweg freche) Antworten auf normale Fragen, Wartezeiten vor (!) der Bestellung von mehr als 15min, Wartezeiten auf die Cocktails die ins unertr\u00e4gliche gingen (mehr als 20min) und nachdem dann mehr als 30-40min eine Gruppe von 12 Personen auf leere Gl\u00e4ser geschaut hat den Laden durstig und komplett frustriert verlassen. \nAuch das Aufssuchen des Diensthabenen h\u00e4tte ich mir sparen k\u00f6nnen, denn dieser hatte nur ein Grinsen f\u00fcr meine Beschwerde (sachlich) \u00fcbrig. Ich empfand das Verhalten als pers\u00f6nlich verletzend und wir sind uns nicht willkommen und st\u00f6rend vorgekommen. Der Laden war im Innenraum max. 25% gef\u00fcllt. \nIch habe wirklich schon sch\u00f6ne Abende im Taquito erlebt, aber die letzten Erfahrungen zwingen mich diese \u00d6rtlichkeit auch mit Gesch\u00e4ftspartnern nicht mehr aufzusuchen (die hier sehr gerne hingehen). Mit mir als Gastgeber werde ich mir so ein Peinlichkeit wie gestern nicht mehr geben. \nNur um meine Darstellung zu konkretisieren: Wir sind mit 12 (!) Personen um 22:30 (!) Uhr in das Lokal. Da in der Bar (logischerweise) f\u00fcr 12 (!) Personen kein Platz mehr war sind wir unter den Sombrero (gro\u00dfer runder Tisch). Direkt nach der Begr\u00fc\u00dfung durch den Kellner wurden wir sehr bestimmt darauf hingewiesen, dass der Barbereich vorne und hier der Restaurantbereich w\u00e4re. Nur Getr\u00e4nke g\u00e4be es vorne (wir konnten uns dann aber durchsetzen). Noch mal zum mitdenken - 12 Personen um 22:30 Uhr! Nun mal noch zum Thema Grundrechenarten: Was ist mehr? 2 Cocktails \u00e1 EUR 7,50 oder ein Buritto (EUR 9,90) + ein Pils f\u00fcr EUR 2,60 ?	negative
Not good, the stuff looks great but very dry and lacking in the flavor department. The only reason we stopped there was because our favorite bakery was closed and we wanted sweets. \nThe place is dirty as well, I didn't expect that from a shop in Summerlin.	negative
I have been here a few times before the Diner, Drive-ins and Dives over the yeart. The only item I have had and really enjoyed was the meat ball sandwich. I was there recently and had the meatball sandwich which I had such fond memories of enjoying and it was okay. So, if I am in the area, I will give it another try.\n\nAnd one more thing, the Guiseppe's on Scottsdale Rd did have better meat ball sandwiches.	negative
If I could give them 0 stars, that would make me happy!  I will never purchase anything from them ever again.  They do not have the products they list in their catalog and when you order them they do not deliver!  No customer service!  Not helpful!  I normally don't write reviews but they have made me so mad, I thought everyone should know how they treat their customers.	negative
Naturally I'm picky about Filipino restaurants because I'll always compare it to my mom-in-law or grandma's cooking. I have been to Thelma's twice and I was a happy customer both times.\n\nOn my first visit, I was ordered Kare Kare (oxtail with veggies in a peanut sauce) and Thelma's special. I always order Kare Kare at every Filipino restaurant I go to because it's my favorite. I found it to be good but not the best I've had and with not enough meat (mind you, I said I was picky). Whenever I see a menu item labeled \""special\"" I expect to be blown away. I thought Thelma's Special to be okay... I found the onions and tomatoes to be a little overpowering. Overall, I was pleased with the food and especially the service.\n\nThe next time I stopped by, I had a hankering for Crispy Pata (fried pork leg). To my dismay, that wasn't on the menu. I settled for the Lechon Kawali instead and Dinuguan (pork blood stew). At first glance, it looked like the servings were small but my husband and I were quite full and had enough leftovers for the next day. What really made me love Thelma's was the quality of the food. The Lechon Kawali had just enough crisp in the skin and was so flavorful. I had never had Dinuguan with so little fat. Usually other Filipino restaurants mix a lot of fat with the meat to be most cost efficient. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very clean and well kept. The service is warm and friendly. The prices are reasonable.  I only wish they had more items on their menu. Otherwise, Thelma's is a restaurant that I would go to again and again!	positive
This place is an amazing hidden gem I am so happy to find good pho and cold noodles out here I will definitely keep coming back	positive
A very good steakhouse that makes sure you leave patting your belly in satisfaction.  The atmosphere here is very dim, and there really isn't a 'fascinating' view of the strip from here, but the service is impeccable.  I haven't experienced anything negative from any of the employees here.  The hostesses are attentive and cordial, the waiters prompt and knowledgeable, and the chefs....well they know what they're doing.\n\nLike most steak houses this place offers a huge porterhouse (24 oz) along with your standard Rib eyes, and NY Strips.  Everything is cooked to the proper doneness that you ask for.  Dishes are served A la carte, so you do have to pay extra for that baked potato or fries to go with your meat.\n\nSpeaking of sides, Their garlic steak fries are a staple for me here.  yes I'm a potato lover, and these fries are actually more like logs.  They're a huge potato that's been quartered, then fried w/ garlic, seasoned, then served.  I recommend you use a fork and knife to chow it down, but nobody says you can't use your fingers too....it is a fry after all.\n\nThe appetizers are great too, I highly recommend the crab & artichoke dip.  It is on the creamy side, but the flavor is great!  The mac & cheese is exceptionally tasty too, fresh cheese, bits of ham, very creamy.\n\nThey do have a cigars available for sale too, and a pretty good wine list.  This place hasn't failed to disappoint yet, except when it ran out of their bagel chips (served as a general appetizer with salsa).	positive
There seems to be a bit of hate for this restaurant based on previous reviews.  Luckily for me there weren't many negatives about my meal here.  So busy in my escapades around Las Vegas on my second day there I completely forgot about taking a break for lunch.  After perusing the menu the night before and observing dishes of what other patrons seemed to be enjoying I decided to drop in on the Dragon Noodle Co. inside the Monte Carlo Hotel & Casino for an early dinner.\n\nI was seated quickly by the restaurant's hostess.  Because it seemed not too busy I was given the option of sitting at a table, at the bar, in the lounge, at the sushi bar or in the main dining room.  I chose the latter, and I was quite surprised as the main dining room was nearly full.  This is another pricey Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas; although, it is not nearly as pricey as Jasmine at the Bellagio.\n\nThe heavy fabric napkins are all sleeved in paper holders printed with the restaurant's graphics (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=TaA0bI9GiB-96VrSODPxEw).  The restaurant uses a baby boy's face (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=DY_GqwfhoJGhbAY1ghUYDg) similar to the little peach boys of Chinese folklore (supposedly brings good fortune) as its main logo, and that image is amusingly plastered throughout the d\u00e9cor of the restaurant.  The wait staff will come around, unsleeve your napkin and place it on your lap for you.  I was quite new to this service so I stopped the young lady and gestured that I can do that myself.  Looking back it was pretty comical what I was actually thinking, but she took my beverage order and walked away.\n\nThree menus are presented, a dinner menu, a sushi menu and a huge, thick binder listing wines and spirits served.  It's a bit too early for a drink, and I never eat sushi at Chinese restaurants so away went those two menus.  They give you time to order here.  My peripheral vision noticed the waiter glancing my way every now and then, but he did not approach my table until I put down the menu.  I ordered the Salt & Pepper Calamari and the Roast Duck half.  Steamed rice is included with most entrees.\n\nMy bowl of rice and the calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=-HfxZmaC7AGYoN11jcimug) were brought out rather quickly.  Understandable as roast duck usually warrants additional preparation time.  The calamari was very good.  The calamari filets were scored, battered and deep fried.  There was just a hint of greasiness.  Salt, pepper and chopped jalapenos are used to season the battered calamari which were served on a bed of shredded lettuce with minced onion and garlic and more jalapeno slices.  The calamari had a nice kick to it.\n\nThe roast duck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=trW1SO7_8uHDTfpnsdTGpQ) was brought out a short time later.  It was served with a sweet and sour plum sauce which I found to be a bit generic in taste.  Where do these places find these ducks that are thick in meat and flavor and can't be found in San Francisco?  I loved the duck which was traditionally roasted Hong Kong style with the thin crispy skin similar to Peking ducks.  The flavor of the marinade was very good and there was tons of duck meat to enjoy.  \n\nIt took me a bit of time, but I managed to polish off everything.   Even so the waiter came by twice to check if everything was okay and whether I wanted more rice.  At the end of my meal he brought me a hot disinfectant towlette sealed in plastic to clean my hands and face.  I passed on dessert although the thought of having some freshly fried sesame balls did enter my mind.	positive
This guy has lousy customer service and an arrogant poor attitude! Stated he did not have \""men\"" working in our area of Lake Norman. Asked him if he subs-out work and he said no it's only him, so his \""men working\"" statement was misleading as it's \""one man working\"". Asked him if he works Mooresville area and he said yes but he won't come on this side of the lake even though we are 20 minutes closer to his office than Mooresville. Says on his website he'll help you fix your problems over the phone but thats a false claim from this experience. AVOID AVOID AVOID Call Tarheel Appliance Service instead 980-225-7802 as they were super nice and helpful....	negative
We just spent the week at THE Hotel and were looking forward to spending time at the pool, but only spent a few hours there during our entire stay because it was over crowded and over priced even for the Strip! After fighting for two chairs in the 115 degree heat and buying an inner-tube for $23 we were then robbed by the \""Bikini Bar\"" for another $24 for a corona and a small pina colada! The lazy river was totally over crowded with screaming, splashing kids! \n\nWe will definitely be back to THE Hotel but will leave the pool for the kids!!!	negative
Finally checked this place out . Cindy was amazing. I will definitely be back for a pedi next week. Also can't wait to bring my 4yr old in to try out the kids pedi chair!!!!	positive
Dense. Weird. Fantastic. I'm not one who knows much about art, let alone the specific details about someone like Andy Warhol. That's exactly why I went. To learn and to experience. This is a really nicely laid out museum and really does a great job paying tribute to a modern great. There is a ton of pieces on display and you could spent days here. If you're in Pittsburgh, I wouldn't hesitate to visit, love him, hate him, or know nothing about him, that's why you should go.	positive
Hi my name is Leo and I'm here cuz my friend couldn't make it.\n  I visit this store about once a week, I could probably be the duke by now but I don't \""check in\"" in liquor stores, being the duke of a liquor store may not look so good on a background check. Having said that, I kind of like this store because I never had a problem finding what I'm looking for,( alcohol) except this time, I was looking for that creme de violette to make that  aviation cocktail I learned at P.J.Clarkes on saloon 101 elite event, but they had no idea what I was talking about. (They gave me that look like they were talking to a drunk.) Oh well.. Since I'm here I might as well pick up some vodka for my friends.\n   This store is huge! They carry a large selection of almost everything. You can find almost any kind of beer you're looking for. The selection of wines is very extensive making it easy to find that special wine for that special event at any budget. The collection of tequilas is also very impressive! But best of all! prices are very reasonable and they also have sales daily. When I was there they had some gin, vodka and wine tasting going on and  I tried them all,.... twice! which Made my friends  ( me, myself, and I ) very happy.\n Clientele at this store is like the clientele at any other liquor store, you'll run into the good the bad and the ugly, this is one of the few places you'll find a cop a priest a hooker and a MADD in the same line. Make sure you look at the wall of pictures of people that went for the ultimate discount, (five fingers) you might know someone there and that's where the party is at!  I'll be back for refills.  Salud Mr. Lee!	positive
FOR THOSE THAT LIKE SALMON FLAVORED CHEWING GUM...\nI've had Krab with a K before but not Phish with a Ph (as in PHOOEY!) A group of friends and I went to The Ka on a Wednesday night and they were closed for construction so we Yelped for an All-You-Can-Eat Sushi (AYCES) place near by. Here is a prime example as to why you cant rely on a Four Star rating when there are only seven ratings. Of the ratings, three were from locals, four from visitors. We Vegas locals take the AYCES trend for granted, but most major cities don't have a lot of AYCES places. When a FOUR STAR review starts like this:\n\n\""7 words...  All-you-can-eat-sushi-to-order! Wow.  Not the best sushi I have ever eaten but when it's all you can eat for $21.95, what can you really complain about?\""\n\ncan you really rely on a review like that? NOT ME! I can excuse the visitors that are enchanted by their first AYCES experience (And who can't? It's like the time you popped your cousin's cherry at church camp!), but I've got seven words for that reviewer: \""Glutton! It's all about the raw fish!\"" \n\nBut it's the locals and those that call this \""the best in Vegas\"" and \""high quality\"" that leave me speechless. For the woman who has been going to this joint for three years (THREE YEARS!!!) here's a bit of advice: Get a date, have him take you out to another respectable AYCES place like The Ka, Sushi Mon, or I Love Sushi, and DISCOVER THERE IS A WHOLE NEW WORLD OUT THERE. Good God, it's like a Mormon who has his first Silver Bullet and thinks he's found the Nectar of the Gods. WALK THE TWO MILES TO THE KA and discover fishy yumminess. You could use the walk after eating so damn much!\n\nLook, there are literally over 100 AYCES joints in Las Vegas, and they range between $21.95 and $27.95. There are some decent places in the $21.95 range, but hell, it's SUSHI, pay the extra few dollars and go to a GREAT PLACE LIKE THE KA!\n\nThe ambiance was the same minimum standard in the valley. It's a good thing I didn't come to eat the decor, because there wasn't any to look at, let alone eat. The sushi bar had 7 stools and they could seat another 30, maybe. At least the place was clean.\n\nBut let's get down to the REAL reason we are here: TO CONSUME A TON OF RAW FISH. Why else are you going to get so excited to eat at an endless trough for $21.95? If you want to just stuff your gullet, go to one of the Station Casinos' Feast Buffet for 2/3 the price and roll yourself home. WE ARE HERE FOR THE FISH, BABY!\n\nWell, at least, that is why I WENT there, but I won't be going back there for the fish. My #1 marker for a good sushi joint is the Salmon, and my girlfriend (former LA food critic) goes by the Yellowtail. While the Yellowtail was passable (but still not \""good\""), the SALMON SUCKED. Wrigley's makes a much tastier chewing gum and it ain't $21.95, either. You know how good salmon looks, that beautiful orange color with as little of the white marbling as possible? Well, apparently they don't at Sushi Bay. Not only was it heavily marbled which made it less than favorable texture, but it had a lot of that brown stuff which is too close to the skin and is just out-right chewy. BLECH. Sadly, it didn't even have that good salmon taste. It was very bland and watery. And they are STRICT and annoying as hell constantly telling you (maybe even threatening you) that they'll charge you for anything you don't eat, so I got stuck eating 10 pieces of bad salmon. Grrrr. \n\nThe menu has a good variety of rolls, but that's typical for almost every sushi place in Vegas these days. The rice was mushy and they use WAY TOO MUCH RICE in the rolls. Only a few were passable. I never get Lobster Rolls in anything but the very expensive joints because THINK ABOUT IT: do you think they can afford to give you GOOD lobster roll for anything less than $20 a roll? Hell no, most places are using the lowest quality lobster just so they can say they have one. And no surprise here at Sushi Bay, it sucked. And of course they are going to suck, as the quality of the fish is rotten. Even the seaweed in the miso soup was chewy, not the light, delicate stuff found in good sushi joints.\n\nLook, you don't have to take my word for it. There are six other people who recommend this place. If you've read my review and the others and you still want to check it out, I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE you to do so. And then come back here and mea culpa and we can go to The Ka together and have some REALLY GOOD SUSHI THERE.\n\nNow, bring me a bucket!	negative
Was a Freakin Frog regular, but got tired of the stuffy attitudes.  I really missed the beer list, though, and Yardhouse doesn't come close. Most Yardhouse beer servers couldn't tell the difference from a Westvleteren and a Bud Light Wheat.  But Money Plays is unpretentious, boasts a Frog-like beer list because they poached one of the best beergeeks (a compliment) ever to pour for Mr. C., the prices are just right and the staff is helpful and knowledgeable.  If you live on the West side of Vegas like me, it's easier to get to.  The interior is nothing to boast about but after a couple of belgians it won't make a bit of difference.  Cheers!	positive
False advertising on Travelocity. You will not get the newly remodeled rooms they show you on Travelocity. The pool chairs are disgusting. The two Yvonne's at the front desk are not very friendly at all. The food at the restaurant was nothing to write home about. No refrigerator and the bed hurt my back. Not sure how this place is still in business. I will NEVER stay here again. Not worth the drive, just stay in downtown Scottsdale or Talking Stick. \n\nThe two stars is for the hotel staff (not the front desk people) and the beautiful backdrop of the surrounding mountains.	negative
Very cool family trip not a lot of activities and the costumed employees acted  like we were actually bothering them. Never the less it was fun and my daughter liked it	positive
It's time for an impromptu dinner session with a close friend.  We just got through watching a friend's internet show cast at The Beat and wanted to grab a bite to eat.  I've been to Fremont Mediterranean Caf\u00e9 before and wanted to bring her here.  She was up for a clean meal so this was a perfect match!\n\nWhen you get into the caf\u00e9, it's exactly that.  A few tables, a long counter to order and a small seating area outside.  It's a nice, quaint size.  The staff is super friendly.  Our cashier initiated some conversation with us and made us feel welcome.  \n\nFor dinner, I got the Turkey Avocado wrap for $8.95.  Pretty affordable, in fact all wraps are $8.95.  My wrap included a spinach tortilla, turkey breast, avocado, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, banana peppers and a pesto spread.  I liked this combination a lot.  The mix of mild red onions and the tanginess of the banana peppers really makes the Mediterranean flavor.  They packed the wrap with turkey so it ended up being super filling.  Avocado and pesto brought the dish together.  It's a huge wrap and you will love it!\n\nThis place is exactly what they advertise:  Fresh, Natural and Healthy.  Ironically, it's located right next to the Heart Attack Grill.  Choose to be healthy and you will certainly love this place!  Come check them out.	positive
Service is consistently underwhelming.   The attractive AND competent servers probably work on the strip.  Food is usually good for bar fare.  Probably won't be back since there are so many other options in the area.	negative
blech.  this isn't pizza.  the steak hoagie tasted decent, but that's not steak either... then again this wouldn't be worst decision you could make at 1AM	negative
Went to dinner on a Saturday night. The food was AH-mazing. So delish. They had a few performers during our meal. A gentleman who sang like some dude in the rat pack. And a soulful woman who sang the blues. Very cool!	positive
Tim Hortons in Montreal is kind of like the Dunkin Donuts in Boston, they are quite literally at every corner of the street. They sell quite an variety of pastries, chocolate bread, muffins, and donuts. The sizes here are usually half of what you would find in a DD, quite fresh and perfect for a snack. Both cold and hot drinks are available from latte to hot chocolate, from smoothies to ice coffee. Although equally as popular as DD in the US, it has less of a fast food type of feel to it, quite cozy and warm.	positive
Really? I had to make reservations for this place? Because on a Saturday night over Labor Day, this Envy The Steakhouse was completely dead. There was one other table in there. When we left, there were maybe 5. We had a restaurant.com coupon, so thank goodness we didn't pay full price for this place, because I would've rather taken my money to Fleming's.\n\nOur waiter was this super mellow guy, and was really nice. He did pay attention to details because he knew we didn't want ice in our water and made sure he didn't accidentally pour it in when it came to refills. It's the little things.\n\nWell, the big thing was the price. We ordered the 10 oz. filet mignon to share between us for $45 and paid a $5 split plate charge. $45?? Are you kidding me?? We started with the gnocchi which had wild mushrooms and parmesan fondue, which was pretty good. We also ordered the steamed broccolini. The steak was definitely not worth the money, because the outside was cooked to a slight crisp (not a problem for me because I like a bit of char), but the inside ranged from well-cooked on the sides, to cold red center, which is not good. A well-cooked filet, ordered medium rare, is a cool pink throughout. What I also didn't like was that they cut the steak in half for us and brought it out on two plates, just because we split it. Well, it probably didn't get to cook enough since you cut the sucker open, and it got colder by the time you brought it to the table. \n\nWhat was good was that your entree comes with a small crock of mashed potatoes and roasted season vegetables, which was yummy. That's a nice addition, considering most steak places just give you a steak, a la carte. \n\nThey had forgotten the steamed broccolini and didn't bring it out until we asked for it. We had a wine from their seven for seven list, which was pretty good for $7. The ambience was very hotel/steakhouse-like. I still felt like I was in a hotel, and I thought the decor was trying a bit hard to be on a more upscale than what it really was. At least I didn't have to dress up to eat here. They didn't balk at my track suit jacket I had with me because I was too lazy to pack anything dressy for the trip. \n\nSo glad we didn't pay full price for it. It was barely worth it even with the coupon. I do not have steak ENVY.	negative
This might sound brash - but for a city built on an excess to the senses, you have to execute things well.\n\nAnd the Cosmopolitan to me, is the name of my favorite drink, and is one of the newest hotels on the Strip that I kept hearing about. So I wanted to see it for myself.\n\nThe styling in the hotel fits me well. I was awed and noted a lot of the little details they infused into the place. It was like Tom Ford had a party with David Bowie and then did drugs with maybe Christian Dior or Diane von Furstenberg. Just very cool, modern, with touches of glamour everywhere.\n\nHowever, a few detrimental notes:\n\nThe Chandelier, was hyped up to me but once I was inside it - it lost its lustre. Yes, you are a sitting in a place strewn with crystals, but I expected a little more. It also didn't do them well, that once sat - it took about 10-15 minutes to be noticed. And this is while everyone is waiting in line at Marquee on a Saturday night. So needless to say, first impression of service... BLEW.\n\nThe signature Cosmopolitan sucked. And for it being the name, I expected something out of it. It's like Carrie Bradshaw took a big wee-wee in my glass. \n\nWhile styled well, the hotel might have been planned out more than what it should have been. Everything was packed in so tight and it made for a bit of claustrophobia. You couldn't see where you were going, when you walked in and about. Best design element that struck a chord were the video walls in the lobby. Those fascinated me the most.\n\nCrowd was okay - it tasted like LA walking through here. There was so many LBDs (or little black dresses to you) that it looked like Herve Leger took a big shit on the place.\n\nBottom line lies in the execution. For paying good money, you still need to be seamlessly good, and the Cosmopolitan failed at that point just on the surface. It still holds my curiosity at this point, but it wouldn't be my first choice to come back to when staying in Vegas - I don't think.	negative
A \""90 minute\"" timeshare presentation took upwards of six hours. Totally ruined our vacation. Then at the end they tried to give us different gifts than we were promised.	negative
the beerfest gets crowder and stupider the closer it gets to the weekend.\n\ni volunteer some of my time working this year at the yelp booth spreading the words to non believers about the virtue of using the website and the app itself. the shit is free to use, what's not to love? at the same time, i got to walk around and sample some beers (coupons are $1 each and beers are between 2 to 6 with the most expensive being around 12 i believe) that sounded interesting before the weekend crowd which is awesome because you get more choices.\n\nmy first stop was at dieu du ciel which you know have really great tasting beer with not much aftertaste if you're a non beer drinker, like i am. i tried the solstice d'\u00e9t\u00e9 which has a sour note because of the raspberry. it is pretty good if you enjoy fruit base alcohol and are looking for something not too off putting. there's the brise-glace which is an apple cider beer. a cider beer? i know! there's no words to describe it besides, fucking good!\n\nmy second stop was at trou du diable. a beerfest without stopping by them is plain stupid! any beer they offer is pretty good. i couldn't remember the name of it but it's definitely not the succubus as that one sold out pretty quick.\n\nthird stop at beau's all natural brew. definitely the highlight of the fest for me. i tried the bog water which is ok but the hogan's goat and especially the russian imp (a black beer) will make a beer lover out of you!\n\nfor my fourth stop, i made my way across the hall to the lovely peluso stand to sample the smoked barley wine from pit caribou that another yelper working the booth suggest me to try. if you are looking for something totally different to try, this one it is. there's that light charcoal taste you get at first and it smooths out once swallow. you'll enjoy it if you love bbq.\n\nmy fifth stop was at the brazilian stand where i tried some banana beer. it smelled like banana, doesn't taste like banana but there's a light sweetness to it that makes it enjoyable provide that you enjoy sweet beer.\n\nsixth and final stop was at the international stand to try some nogne brand beer. it's a norwegian beer brand and by that time, i was pretty out of it so i can't really remember anything besides drinking it all.\n\nUPDATE: on my last day working the yelp booth, me and some yelper sample some more stands. At first, we were looking for a second round of la brise-glace from dieu but they were sold out. kinda a bit bum, I walked over to our neighbour booth friend and asked if they knew about any other cider vendor which led us to la branche. The ice cider wasn't bad while the maple cider and the bubbly cider were hits amongst us. Before that, I walked over to the maple stand for some maple cider tasting. While I don't remember the name, there's one cider that had a maple butter like taste. It was rich, creamy and so ever smooth, it was like drinking liquid gold. Too bad you had to shell out money for a bottle instead of getting a 4 ouncer like most booths. And I went back to peluso for a second go at that smoked barley. I don't know if it was because of the maple cider I taste just before but I detected some lychee note amongst other things in the beer which I didn't previously. interesting\n\nfor food, i stopped by the globe trotteur stand to get some seal merguez and skippy burger (kangaroo). it is a bit pricey for what you're getting (the skippy is a slider) even though it's pretty tasty. if i could keep on affording it, i'd keep eating skippy ;)\n\nbad monkey popcorn is some freaking good popcorn! the ketchup one is not bad, a bit sweet like you'd expect from ketchup powder stuff. the jalapeno is quite spicy! me and some yelper choked on some kernels. the nachos and all dressed ones were the best of the bunch. considering it's 2 for $5, you can't go wrong with both. i did hear that they have some caramel and jalapeno popcorn which sounded interesting.\n\nUPDATE: while I was enjoying some wine I sneak in from home (had to drink something else too), I felt it was missing some cheese so I head over to fromage d'ici and got a trio of Roy Leo (I think) cheese plate. It was some good cheese but the mouthwatering one was the cheese fondue platter of the 3 cheeses that I got too. Made with some white wine, we just couldn't help ourselves. Words don't do justice of how good it was. You have to put it in your mouth to really grasp the collective mouthgasm we had!\n\nwe did get some freebies from our neighbour beer booth but that is between booth neighbours.\n\nmost staff working are pretty nice and friendly. we even got them to join in our photo madness!\n\nif you love beer or want to try something better than the non drinkable commercial stuff you get at grocery stores, you ought to attend the fest and sample. the best times are wednesday and early thursday where you can stroll around and hear yourself talk. i didn't really like beer but after trying multiple ones, i can definitely say it's almost love at first beer	positive
Get here early for lunch...they get filled up. Sandwiches are great as is the soup.  I have moved from Charlotte, but I have never found an egg salad that competes.	positive
Back in August, in the peak of summer heat, a local showed me this place because he knows Im a vegetarian (a hard thing to be in Vegas!). I was very suspicious of his recommendation because most Thai places are not strictly vegetarian and can get pretty slippery when it comes to the fish oil. I was very pleasantly surprised by the integrity of their veggie options... they didnt smell fishy in the least.\n\nIn fact, their intentions were so clean that when I asked for \""hot\"" on the \""low/medium/hot\"" scale, the waitress refused! I said, \""come on, i want it hot, baby!\"" said: \""you cant handle \""the hot\"", im sorry darling\""... and the more she denied me her spicy goodness, the more I wanted it. finally she gave it up when I said, \""lacking any chest hair, i've disgraced my indian ancestors, now gimme those chilies to get my testosterone flowin' sweetheart!\"" she winked at me, and sent in the order.\n\nand lemme tell ya, the \""hot\"" was frickin' amazing... made us sweat bullets, and nothing beats the Vegas summer than a blazing hot bowl of green curry. unfortunately my friend (the local), completely forgetting how tortuously hot the curry was,  gave the left overs to a homeless guy sitting on the street under the 110 degree heat. poor dude didnt even have a bottle of water handy either!	positive
Ohh don't get me started on Cox.  First when you have ANY problem at all, getting a live human being on the phone takes up to 15 minutes as you weave your way through \""press one for... ok now press ..\"".  Then the most they can do if your cable isn't working is tell you to unplug the box  and plug it back in.  Technical genius!  Then they schedule you a cocky, know-it-all but still somehow totally unhelpful technician to come out like four or eight days later.  We've been through seven boxes since we moved  six months ago because the dvr freezes and doesn't record properly ... on a regular basis.  I just think for the RIDICULOUS amount they charge me, the fact that we MUST have cable just to get any kind of regular programming, and the amount of problems their service has on a regular basis ... it should be a HELL OF A LOT EASIER TO GET ISSUES RESOLVED OR EVEN JUST TO TALK TO A LIVE PERSON.	negative
My experience was alright. The food was average. I was expecting amazing from all the buss about this place. Our waiter was sub-par and not very attentive to us, or nice for that matter and there was this really loud and obnoxious blonde waitress's that kept yelling and singing very badly to the music. She didn't even know the words. Very annoying. Just cause it wasn't that busy doesn't mean there aren't customers here. It was so annoying to eat with this waitress walking around being so irritating.	negative
I attended the mothers day brunch here as part of Vegas Uncorked 09'. It was hands down one of the best meals I have ever had. I find myself daydreaming about it constantly. All of the food was served family style and was absolutely amazing. I really enjoyed every single dish that was served but the dishes that stood out the most to me were the pork belly and wagyu skirt steak. DROOL!The service was top notch. The waiters kept the unlimited champagne and mimosas flowing.  And they were happy to get us additional servings of the dishes if we wanted more. My table went through a lot of the pork belly. It was awesome to see Tom Colicchio and get an autographed cookbook that included recipes of some of the items we ate that day. I definitely recommend this place and can not wait to go back!	positive
My husband, 3 year old daughter and I ate at Renegade last nite with another couple.  We hade been meaning to go for months and I am glad we finally made it.  I am always a little aprehensive to go to a new place with my daughter since I never know if the atmosphere would be good for kids or not.  Is this a place you can let your kids run around in? No However, they have a greta kids menu and give the kids a cactus coloring sheet and crayons.  The atmosphere has a good vibe and a nice buzz.  (I don't frequent quiet places with my 3 year old so this was great).  \n\nThe restaurant is really beautiful. I was surprised how busy it was at 6:30 (full, as was the bar)\n\nWe had a variety of dishes starting with the green chili pork stew and tortillas as an appetizer. This was amazing!  I could seriously go back for dinner again and have this as my meal. Everyone loved it.\n\nOther dishes we had:\n*  Filet Mignon - This had great flavor and was a good cut of meat. The mashed potatoes that came with it were just OK (I am picky when it comes to these)\n* Burger - HUGE. way too big to eat without a knife and fork.  It was REALLY good. I am not a big sauce person and I even liked the sauce that came on it (maybe a chipotle mayo or something like that) Skinny fries were delish.\n* Green chili mac and cheese - this was soooooo yummy! You can actually order a small side. We did just to taste it and I am glad we did. Really yummy and the texture was great with the combo of soft noodles and toasty bread crumbs.\n* Caesar salad - fresh, crips greens - a little (just enough) garlic. This was topped with jalapeno croutons and they were great.\n* Pot Roast - I didn't try it but my friend loved it\n* Roasted Chicken - Again, didn't try this but it got rave reviews.  I saw several people eating this while we were there as well.\n* Bread pudding - this was really great - and it has some sort of rare mushroom in it that gives it the caramel/maple flavor. yum!\n* My daughter had the vanilla ice cream (I wasn't sure if it was ice cream or gelato but it was home made and delish!)\n\nWe will definitely be back to Renegade.	positive
After attending a nearby Yelp event, a few yelpers decided it was time for a burger. I heard Bobby Flay, burgers and beer....I was sold! \n\nI was instantly impressed with the layout of this joint. The tables were in a semi \""S\"" shaped style, which made for interesting dining. The tables were large and held about 10 people. The entire setup of the restaurant was fun and creative. No one walked away from our table a stranger. \n\nThe line was long but went quickly. We waited less than 5 minutes from the time we walked in until the time we placed our order. I approached the cashier knowing exactly what I wanted. I was quick to order and to pay. \n\nThe Bill: $22.16.....ehhh\n\nThe Brunch Burger - certified Angus beef, fried egg, smoked bacon and American cheese. I like my meat a little pink to keep the flavor so I ordered medium. The burger was nicely cooked but on your typical sesame seed bun. The egg and bacon was amazing, really who could argue with a fried egg and smoked bacon?? The burger was good but not the best burger I've ever had.  Not sure it was worth the $9.50, but I knew walking in I was paying for the name behind the burger. \n\nThe Half and Half - you can order one side for $4 each or combine 2 sides for $5. You have the option to get french fries, sweet potato fries or beer battered onion rings. I decided to go for the the regular fries, with the all amazing BBP Fry Sauce and the Beer Battered Onion Rings. The fries were tasty, crisp and all around the perfect fries. No complaints. I was a little disappointed to only see 2 onion rings come with the half and half. I mean really, those rings were perfect and you're going to tease me with only 2? \n\nBeer - Miller Lite. Yes, BBP has its own decent selection of beers, drinks, wines spiked milkshakes and margaritas, I stuck to my roots and went with a Miller Lite. After all, they didn't have PBR. \n\nOverall, the food was good but nothing about it stood out to make my mouth water as I write my review. The staff checked on us regularly and even made sure we all had beers when we were getting low. Just because of the experience, friendliness of the staff and my urge to try more burgers on the menu, I will probably return.	positive
Extremely enjoyable place with a warm atmosphere, fantastic Bloody Mary, great beer and whiskey selections	positive
When it comes to getting a pet a fish is usually the standard place to start.  They offer admittedly only a mild amount of entertainment, but it does offer a cheap test of your commitment to caring for a very undemanding living being.  You may even grow to love fish and their simple nature that never tires of going up and down the same old stretch of water.\n\nHaving decided to get a fish you simply must come here as it can't be matched by anything you get elsewhere.  The range is simply unbelievable and despite this the prices are very good.  This is the one stop fish shop.	positive
Firefly...you finally made it to Hendertucky! It's always busy, which is a sign of great food and they never split large party checks which is a sign of laziness BUT...the place never leaves me disappointed and always leaves me craving more.	positive

I love Trader Joes!! Living downtown has turned me into a 2+ times a week shopper of TJs. I love how cheap and unique everything is. The staff is friendly, like really friendly, like they cant wait to get out of bed and sell groceries . TJ has all of the staples of my life for a great price; hummus, produce, meat, cheese, and WINE. \n\nOnly have 2 small complaints. One is parking (at the Met location). I have solved this by parking across king street in the big empty lot and taking the crosswalk over to the Met. Second, sometimes it takes a LONG time to check out. I think this has something to do with the uber friendliness of the staff. And please, for Christ Sake, start bagging your things as they are checking you out.	positive
I thought about giving Paisan's just one star but decided the amazing view was worth another. I'll start by saying that there probably isn't another restaurant in Madison with such a prime, waterfront location.\n\nAnd that's a huge shame because the food here is no good. It's supposedly Italian, but less authentic (and less tasty) than Olive Garden. The dishes are so plain - why should I go out to eat to order spaghetti in tomato sauce? Sure, at a really good Italian place simple works well, but here the food really does not taste professional at all. Pizza is the easiest thing in the world to make taste amazing yet at Paison's it is so mediocre. It probably says something about the kitchen's culinary expertise that the menu boasts a ham sandwich with banana peppers as the restaurant's most famous item.\n\nI would only say go here if you must, must eat on the water downtown. Even then, I would probably rather get food at the terrace or something.	negative
I had high hopes, but i was not impressed. this is the first show i started falling asleep with. It came with my hotel when we stayed there. It had high flying acrobatics with water. the performers come from the roof hooked to cable. I didn't really hate it i just wasn't impressed. Glad i didnt have to pay for it.	negative
My wife and I want to Geno's because our usual (and favorite place) Venezia's was packed.  To be honest, we should have waited at Venezia's.\n\nWe each had a slice and split the Greek Salad.  The pizza was horrible, reminded me school lunch pizza.  The dough at Geno's tasted frozen and looked unappetizing when I lifted up to look at the bottom.  \n\nWe will not be back and wouldn't recommend this place to others.	negative
Average burger, average taste, above average prices. Anyone who thinks this is good food has no credibility when it comes to food. If you want cheap cheese, bland meat, and a lot of grease and want to pay too much this is the place. I go to Columbus OH for work, Graffiti burger is the place over there. They have a big sign over the Five Guys in Columbus. I passed by the Five Guys, almost empty, go to Graffiti, PACKED. There is a reason for that, they serve the best burgers around. I so wish AZ had a place like that. Until that happens, I am in search for the best burger in AZ.	negative
My girlfriend and I went there this past Sunday for the second time.  We went previously for my birthday and had a great experience.  The food is always great and very hot when it comes out.  I love steak so it is always right up my alley.  This past Sunday's experience fell short.  Our waitress, although nice, was not attentive and did not listen to what we had to say.  We ordered an appetizer and needed it prepared in a certain way, but it did not come out as we ordered.  We saw our waitress all of three times the entire night.  My girlfriend ordered a bottle of wine which was on the \""last call\"" list.  We waited 20 minutes before she came to tell us that the bottle was not available.  The busboy that was associated with our waitress might as well have been our server.  He was great.  He made sure everything was to our liking and even refreshed my girlfriends wine glass.  \n\nWhen the food did arrive, we were satisfied with it.  The two times that we have been, the food is always exceptional.  But, you can't help but notice the lack of service.  I have to say it did affect our time there on Sunday, but won't hold us back from coming back.  We can only hope that the service will be better the next time.	negative
xl pick up pizza good deal. ghetto area\n wouldn't walk there at nite. Chick taking orders kinda rude. Expensive for delivery but pick up u get what u pay for.	positive
I have thought about writing this review for a while and have finally decided to get out. I have been with this practice for over three years now and the service has consistently declined. Within the past year the time it takes to even make appointments has increased to 15min of waiting on hold just to then have them tell you that they don't have any appointment times open that will suit your schedule for at least two weeks. I have not seen the same physician each time I have visited in the past year and only one time have I received courteous service. If you want to be able to see the doctor in a timely manner and have the staff at least seem like they care about you consistently, then South Point Family Practice is not the place for you.	negative
We live on Montreal and this is one of our favorite breakfast spots. We always recommend our friends and guests go here when in town.\nSide of French toast, an ABSOLUTE must!!!	positive

Rockin' Taco is located on the second floor.  The bar overlooks the strip.  Bf and I sat at the bar and grabbed food from the adjacent station.  I ordered a salad with beef and guac.  The staff was stingy with the ingredients.  The quesadilla was okay.  Meat was $2 extra and there was also a $2 extra charge for the guac.  Meat is low grade and is tough.\n\nBartender was shady.  She hit on my bf once when I went to get food and another time when I went to the restroom.	negative
My girlfriend and I planned our trip to Vegas down to the minute.  We left nothing to chance and did extensive research.  It was her first trip to Vegas (I had been before) and besides, she's a planner.  So when looking into nightclubs, we wanted to find 2, one for Friday and one for Saturday, that we HAD to see, and then one or two more to go to after if it turned out the first wasn't all it was cracked up to be or if we just wanted to check out something else.\n\nFriday night was XS and we were disappointed.  We left after 90 minutes or so and headed to The Act, which we loved.  Our second night was going to be an \""off-strip\"" night.  Firstly, we wanted to check our as many rooftop lounges and clubs for comparison, and between Rio and Palms, there's like 3 or 4.  And in our research, Voodoo looked like the best, so our first club Sat was Voodoo, and our backup was Ghostbar in Palms.  We never left Voodoo.\n\nFirstly, you have to start with the view.  Voodoo has 2 outdoor levels, and both have fantastic views.  We were there in mid April, so the weather was perfect.  The inside of the club was nice - maybe not the fanciest or coolest place, but it was upscale.  Dance floor was a bit small.  Regardless, there was no one inside - why would you be for a place like this.  When you could dance to great music and those views, it makes for a great night.\n\nSecond, music.  This is the type of music I want to hear.  Top 40, hip hop, dance.  Not house.  Mix some house in if you must to show off your DJ skills, but stick to what people like to listen to.  Admittedly, this was an older crowd and I think we (I'm 35) prefer top 40 over house music.  But you can dance to it, sing to it, and just have fun.  The only strange thing with the music was that the DJ for the lower outdoor level was playing the same songs as the upper level DJ, just maybe an hour or so behind.  I'm not sure if that was intentionally, but my girlfriend and I were on the upper level for a couple of hours, but then had an issue with another patron, so we decided to walk down the outdoor stairs to the lower level (it's only one floor down - still practically rooftop).  We got down there, and heard maybe half a dozen or so songs that we had heard upstairs earlier in the evening.  So that was strange.\n\nOur only problem was old people who can't handle their liquor.  There was some woman there, having fun, and dancing like there was no one around her.  Head and arms flailing all over the place.  Voodoo didn't get nearly as crowded as the other clubs - there was a crowd, but there was room to dance and move around - but regardless, club goers, you have to be aware of your surroundings.  Show a little restraint in your spasms.  This drunk 40 some year old was throwing her arms around and knocked my girlfriends drink, hard, right out of her hands.  The drink hit the ground and splashed on at least 2-3 other people.  So while we're apologizing profusely to everyone else, this woman went on like nothing happened.  Thankfully, everyone around us understood and we didn't have a problem, but this idiot didn't even acknowledge what she did, much less replace my girlfriends drink.  So it put a damper on the night, but we still had fun.\n\nTherefore, if you're okay with a 30-40 year old crowd that forgot how to party, then you should absolutely go to Voodoo.  Besides XS and Act, my only other club experiences in Vegas were Rain at Palms, which is now closed, and Studio 54 at MGM, also closed, so I don't have many places to compare it to, but I think this has got to be one of the best.	positive

I work graveyard shift and order food from here 2-3 times a week. I have tried most of the menu and can't think of anything that I didn't like. The service is friendly and every time I call they remember me by name.	positive
My friend suggested I stay here while visiting her, since it was close to where she lives. The price considering the other resorts nearby seemed the best I could do financially, so I reserved a room here. No problems with the reservation, or check in. Nothing special really, and \""adequate\"" would be the best way to describe this place. They do have an outdoor pool for the kids. They also have a coffee bar along with bagels and some baked wrapped goods. Again nothing special and I understand that since I made the suggestion of having 2 pots of each coffee ready for guests, they are going to make that change. I noticed people behind me had to wait 10 minutes for a new pot to brew, and when you are in a hurry you don't want to wait that long.\nMy room consisted of a queen bed, a couch and tv and a little dining area of refrigerator with freezer, and some dishes and a small stove. I didn't cook anything while here so I can't comment on the stove.\nThe bathroom has a tub which I appreciated, however no shampoo is provided and I had to go down the following morning to request some. No conditioner is available either. Again, an adequate hair dryer IS provided which was nice to have since I didn't bring one. I didn't know this but they don't provide room service daily, only for people staying more then 7 days I believe. I requested more pillows the next morning, after a sleepless night of tossing and turning on my ironing board comfortable bed. When I returned that evening NON were provided. The next morning I went down to get a cup of coffee, but my coffee consisted of grinds. I told the manager at the front desk who led me back to where they brew the coffee, and got a fresh cup.\nI also explained how uncomfortable the bed was, and the pillows being so squishy they provided no  support whatsoever. He offered to have them flip the mattress over, but I didn't think that would make a difference. The pillows I requested WERE in the room by my return that evening.\nI probably would have to stay here again since it is fairly close to my friend, and not far from Scottsdale Blvd which is a major road for everything.  However, if I can find something around the same price, I wouldn't hesitate to go elsewhere.\nThe rooms are clean so no worry there, and the staff is very dedicated to trying to make your stay a good one so I can't fault them for that.\nHowever, I think they need to update their beds and pillows, because I am paying to sleep there, and would have loved a great nights sleep.	negative
Love the shrimp tacos here!!!	positive
I am very picky about breakfast and this place is phenomenal. Saw on Man vs. food and was in Vegas on vacation so we wanted to experience for ourselves. I don't usually indulge in biscuits with sausage gravy, but this one served over smashed potatoes was worth every single calorie! My other friends got different versions of hash and couldn't stop raving about it! Definitely worth the drive or cab ride off strip!	positive
This is one of our favourite restaurants in Phoenix.  We've been back numerous times, bringing family and friends, and it never fails to disappoint.  That's what keeps us coming back.  The service and food are always top notch.	positive
Food was subpar.  Clams were not fresh.  Service made up for a little bit of it.  Our waiter was really attentive.	negative
Ouch! I never wished I steped foot inside this bar. The female bartender seemed liked we were a nuisance in between her twitter updates. I wish I could get paid to update my social media status instead of serving my customers. Didn't even bother to stay to try the food. We left after one drink because of the poor service. It was not a pleasurable experience.	negative
I went to this place after seeing a segment on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (Food Network).  I thought that the fusion of Chinese & Mexican food would be good.  I was a bit disapointed.  The food was okay, but nothing too special.  The establishment itself was clean and the service was quick, so kudos to them for that.	negative
Exactly what you expect from Chick Fil A.  Consistent food, and great service and a clean restaurant.  Definitely the best of the fast food chains and this one is definitely good.  Only drawback is that is usually very busy, but that is a testament to the food and the experience.	positive
Checked into a room that was still being cleaned. Had to wait 20 minutes outside room for completion of cleaning only to find hair all over the bathroom. Very poor service and  service recovery.	negative
I was SO looking forward to eating at Modern Steak. A group of friends decided we should hit up Modern Steak for dessert, we were a large party, so we made reservations about 2 weeks in advance. We arrived and I was so impressed with the decor, I knew we were in for a treat. We were ushered  to a private room in the back. I was a little surprised at the set up, they had one long table set up for about 20-24 people (we were only a group of 15), and the only way to get from one side of the table to the other (or out of the room if god forbid you had to exit to use the restroom), was through a narrow, 12 inch space between the edge of the table and the glass wall. The wait staff quickly brought in our desserts, a selection of mini-cupcakes (my favorite), including carrot cake, banana, chocolate and of course red velvet. We attempted to make drink orders (I believe the wait staff took half of the table's drink orders), after asking the waiter for some wine recommendations, he said he would send the sommolier in. I think the sommolier came in with one person's wine. It was so chatotic it was hard to say what was going on. After 15 minutes, I had yet to even receive a glass of water, and did not get to start on my cupcakes until after asking several waiters (and getting dirty looks) for a glass of water. The cupcakes were the only thought that kept me going, I knew they were going to be worth it...what a giant let down. Save your money and whip up a batch of Duncan Hines Red Velvet cupcakes, they will be a HUNDRED times better. I doubt I will ever return to Modern Steak.	negative
Had a 430 appt. It's now 530. They said 20 more minutes. It's nice could use some upgrade to facility.  Overall service blah..Overbooked patients. I've been waiting for this second appt for them to advise me we may not get finished. What the heck, 3 appts for 3 cavity s ummm no its hard enough to schedule around work. After this we probably will not be back. Did I mention OVERBOOKED HURRY UP AND WAIT. NO GOOD PATIENT CARE. WE ARE NUMBERS.	negative
